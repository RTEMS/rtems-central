  If the period name is not unique, then the period identifier will match the
  first period with that name in the search order.  However, this period
  identifier is not guaranteed to correspond to the desired period.  The period
  identifier is used with other rate monotonic related directives to access the
  period.

  The objects are searched from lowest to the highest index.  Only the local
  node is searched.
