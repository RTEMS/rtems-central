  The GR-CPCI-GR740 Development Board comprises a custom designed PCB in a 6U
  Compact PCI format, making the board suitable for stand-alone bench top
  development, or if required, to be mounted in a 6U CPCI Rack, or in a
  bench-top enclosure. The principle interfaces and functions are accessible on
  the front and back edges of the board, and secondary interfaces via headers
  on the board. The  GR-CPCI-GR740 Development Board comes as standard with a
  dedicated accessory board which provides access to additional I/O interfaces.

  Features:

  * GR740 quad-core 32-bit fault-tolerant LEON4FT SPARC V8 processor

  * cPCI interface (32 bit) configurable with jumpers for Host or Peripheral
    operation

  * PCI arbiter implemented in separate FPGA

  * On-board memory:

    * SDRAM SODIMM module - Delivered with two 256 MiB modules that provide a
      total 256 MiB of accessible data RAM plus ECC check bits.

    * Parallel Boot Flash 64 Mbit (16 bit wide x 4M or 8 bit wide x 8M)

    * Additional memory via memory expansion connector

  * Power, reset, clock and auxiliary circuits

  * Interfaces at front edge of board:

    * Dual RJ45 10/100/1000 Mbit GMII/MII Ethernet interface (KSZ9021GN)

    * 8 port SpaceWire interface (8x MDM9S)

    * SpaceWire debug communications link (MDM9S)

    * 16-bit General purpose I/O (34 pin 0.1" ribbon cable style connector)

    * FTDI Serial to USB interface (FT4232HL with USB-Mini-AB)

    * LED indicators connected to GPIO signals

    * DIP switch for bootstrap and PLL interface configuration

    * Push button switch for reset and toggle switch (on/off) for DSU break

  * Interfaces at back edge of board:

    * Compact PCI interface (32-bit), configurable for Host or Peripheral slot

    * Input power connector: 5V nominal

  * Interfaces on-board:

    * SPI  interface on pin headers

    * JTAG Debug interface

    * 4-pin IDE style power connector

    * Assorted jumpers and Test Points for configuration and test of the board

  * To accommodate the optional/alternative I/O interfaces the accompanying
    accessory board provides

    * Dual MIL-1553 Interface (Transceiver/Transformer and D-sub 9 Male
      connector)

    * Dual CAN Interface (CAN Transceivers and two D-sub 9 Male connectors)

    * Two Serial UART (RS232 transceivers and two D-sub 9 female connectors)

    * SPI interface (available via 10 pin header)
