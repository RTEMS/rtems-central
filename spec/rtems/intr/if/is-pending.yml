  Interrupts may be made pending by calling the ${raise:/name} or

  pending state may be cleared by ${clear:/name}.

    is the pointer to a ``bool`` object.  When the directive call is
    successful, the pending status of the interrupt associated with the
    interrupt vector specified by ${.:/params[0]/name} will be stored in this
    object.  When the interrupt was pending for the processor executing the
    directive call at some time point during the call, the object value will be
    set to ${/c/if/true:/name}, otherwise to ${/c/if/false:/name}.
