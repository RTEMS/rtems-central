notes: |
  The build label can be used to distinguish test suite results obtained from
  different build configurations.  A use case is to record test results with
  performance data to track performance regressions.  For this a database of
  performance limits is required.  The build label and the target hash obtained
  from ${get-target-hash:/name} can be used as a key to obtain performance
  limits.
