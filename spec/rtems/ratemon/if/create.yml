  This directive creates a period which resides on the local node.  The period
  has the user-defined object name specified in ${.:/params[0]/name} The
  assigned object identifier is returned in ${.:/params[1]/name}.  This
  identifier is used to access the period with other rate monotonic related
  directives.

notes: |
  The calling task is registered as the owner of the created period.  Some
  directives can be only used by this task for the created period.

  For control and maintenance of the period, RTEMS allocates a
  ${/glossary/pcb:/term} from the local PCB free pool and initializes it.
