      The name consists either of an identifier, or an identifier and an alias.
      The identifier and alias are separated by a colon (``:``).  The
      identifier shall match with the name of a register definition of the item
      (see ${interface-register:/spec-name}) or the name of a register block
      include of the item
      (see ${interface-register-block-include-role:/spec-name}).  If no alias
      is specified, then the identifier is used for the register block member
      name, otherwise the alias is used.  If the register block member names
      are not unique within the item, then a postfix number is appended to the
      names.  The number starts with zero for each set of names.
