  Defining ${../if/appl-disable-filesystem:/name} is mandatory for applications
  using only the pre-qualified feature set.  The reason is to get linker errors
  in case such applications are linked if they depend on the files system
  support.  Thus no validation test case can be used.  Inspection of the
  referenced ${/glossary/sourcecode:/term} file showed that several data
  structures are initialized with references to functions which are not in the
  pre-qualified feature set, if ${../if/appl-disable-filesystem:/name} is not
  defined.  For the pre-qualified only build of RTEMS, this would lead to an
  unresolved reference linker error.  This shows that the
  ${../req/appl-disable-filesystem:/spec} requirement is implemented as specified.
