notes: |
  IDLE threads shall not block.  A blocking IDLE thread results in undefined
  system behaviour because the scheduler assume that at least one ready thread
  exists.

  IDLE threads can be used to initialize the application, see configuration
  option ${idle-task-init-appl:/name}.

  The BSP may have knowledge of the specific CPU model, system controller
  logic, and peripheral buses, so a BSP-specific IDLE task may be capable of
  turning components off to save power during extended periods of no task
  activity.
