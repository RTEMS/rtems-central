  The pinning of threads to a processor is an important feature to support
  dynamically allocated lock-free data structures.  It allows efficient and
  safe access to processor-specific data structures.  It is used for example to
  implement the Epoch Based Reclamation in libbsd.  The libbsd is a port of
  FreeBSD kernel modules to RTEMS.
