  When the macro ${../if/declare-global-symbol:/name} appears at file scope,
  and argument ${../if/declare-global-symbol:/params[0]/name} after undergoing
  C pre-processor substitutions results in a valid C identifier name,
  and this identifier name is not yet defined at file scope,
  the macro ${../if/declare-global-symbol:/name} shall apply all possible C
  pre-processor substitutions to its argument value
  before it results in code which declares a global symbol
  with the respective name.
type: requirement
