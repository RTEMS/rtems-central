  To avoid this, produce an artificial side effect with ``asm ("");``.

  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and the ${../if/no-inline:/name} macro is used as last part of a
  function declaration or is attached to a function definition,
  and the function has side-effects,
  the macro shall prevent the compiler from inlining this function.
