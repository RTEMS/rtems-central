  The current priority of a ${task:/term} is the ${priority-task:/term} with
  respect to the ${scheduler-home:/term} of the task.  It is an aggregation of
  the ${priority-real:/term} and temporary priority adjustments due to locking
  protocols, the rate-monotonic period objects on some schedulers such as EDF,
  and the ${posix:/term} sporadic server.  The current priority is an
  ${priority-eligible:/term}.
