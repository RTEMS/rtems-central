  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and argument ${../if/obfuscate-variable:/params[0]/name}
  is an automatic variable or function argument,
  and the value of that variable or function argument is of a type
  which fits into a register,
  the ${../if/obfuscate-variable:/name} macro shall prevent the compiler
  from performing optimizations based on the variable value.
