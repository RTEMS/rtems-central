  This directive sends the message ${.:/params[1]/name} of ${.:/params[2]/name}
  bytes in length to the queue specified by ${.:/params[0]/name}.  If a task is
  waiting at the queue, then the message is copied to the waiting task's buffer
  and the task is unblocked. If no tasks are waiting at the queue, then the
  message is copied to a message buffer which is obtained from this message
  queue's message buffer pool.  The message buffer is then placed at the rear
  of the queue.
