  ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_PREREQUISITE_DRIVERS`` is defined if the
  application has device drivers it needs to include in the Device Driver
  Table.  This should be defined to the set of device driver entries that
  will be placed in the table at the *FRONT* of the Device Driver Table and
  initialized before any other drivers *EXCEPT* any BSP prerequisite drivers.

  In some cases, it is used by System On Chip BSPs to support peripheral
  buses beyond those normally found on the System On Chip. For example, this
  is used by one RTEMS system which has implemented a SPARC/ERC32 based board
  with VMEBus. The VMEBus Controller initialization is performed by a device
  driver configured via this configuration parameter.
