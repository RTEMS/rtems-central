  The rate monotonic state indicates whether the period is currently used to
  execute ${../glossary/job:/plural} or not.  In the former case it also
  indicates whether the current ${../glossary/job:/term} is still within the
  planed time ${../glossary/interval:/term} or not.  A rate monotonic period can
  be in one of these three states:

  * ${../glossary/inactive:/term}
  * ${../glossary/active:/term}
  * ${../glossary/expired:/term}
