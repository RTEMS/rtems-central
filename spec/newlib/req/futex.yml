rationale: |
  With the futex support, highly efficient ${/glossary/smp:/term}
  synchronization primitives which offer random fairness can be provided by
  RTEMS.  The futex support is required by the OpenMP implementation from
  ${/glossary/gcc:/term}.  It is used for barriers which are a core
  synchronization primitive of OpenMP.
