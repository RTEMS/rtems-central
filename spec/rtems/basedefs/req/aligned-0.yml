  Note that the ${../if/aligned:/name} macro can often only increases the
  alignment but under some circumstances, it can also decrease the alignment.

  When the argument ${../if/aligned:/params[0]/name} is a
  positive power of two integer,
  and the macro ${../if/aligned:/name} is used on a none-``static``
  variable or structure field,
  and the used linker supports alignments of the size given by the
  ${../if/aligned:/params[0]/name} argument,
  and the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  the macro shall specify a minimum alignment for the variable or
  structure field, measured in bytes.
