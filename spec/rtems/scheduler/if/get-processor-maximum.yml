description: |
  In uniprocessor configurations, this macro evaluates to a compile time
  constant of one.

  In SMP configurations, this macro returns the minimum of the processors
  (physically or virtually) available by the platform and the configured
  processor maximum.  Not all processors in the range from processor index zero
  to the last processor index (which is the processor maximum minus one) may be
  configured to be used by a scheduler or may be online (online processors have
  a scheduler assigned).
