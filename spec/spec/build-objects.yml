      This set of attributes specifies a set of object files used to build
      static libraries or test programs. Objects Items must not be included on
      multiple paths through the build dependency graph with identical build
      options. Violating this can cause race conditions in the build system due
      to duplicate installs and multiple instances of build tasks.
