appl-config-option-data-type: |
  Boolean feature macro.
appl-config-option-default-value: |
  This is not defined by default.
appl-config-option-description: |
  ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_RTC_DRIVER`` is defined if the application
  wishes to include the Real-Time Clock Driver.
appl-config-option-index: []
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_RTC_DRIVER
appl-config-option-notes: |
  Most BSPs do not include support for a real-time clock. This is because
  many boards do not include the required hardware.

  If this is defined and the BSP does not have this device driver, then the
  user will get a link time error for an undefined symbol.
appl-config-option-range: |
  Defined or undefined.
