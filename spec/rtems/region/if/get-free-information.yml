notes: |
  This directive uses the same structure to return information as the
  ${get-information:/name} directive but does not fill in the used information.

  This is primarily intended as a mechanism to obtain a diagnostic information.
  This method forms am O(n) scan of the free in the region to calculate the
  information provided. Given that the execution time is driven by the number
  of used and free blocks, it can take a non-deterministic time to execute.
  Typically, there are many used blocks and a much smaller number of used
  blocks making a call to this directive less expensive than a call to
  ${get-information:/name}.
