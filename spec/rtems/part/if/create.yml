description: |
  This directive creates a partition of fixed size buffers from a physically
  contiguous memory space which starts at ${.:/params[1]/name} and is
  ${.:/params[2]/name} bytes in size.  Each allocated buffer is to be of
  ${.:/params[3]/name} in bytes.  The partition has the user-defined object
  name specified in ${.:/params[0]/name}.  The assigned object identifier is
  returned in ${.:/params[5]/name}.  This identifier is used to access the
  partition with other partition related directives.

  The **attribute set** specified in ${.:/params[4]/name} is built through a
  *bitwise or* of the attribute constants described below.  Not all
  combinations of attributes are allowed.  Some attributes are mutually
  exclusive.  If mutually exclusive attributes are combined, the behaviour is
  undefined.  Attributes not mentioned below are not evaluated by this
  directive and have no effect.  Default attributes can be selected by using
  the ${../../attr/if/default:/name} constant.

  The partition has a local or global **scope** in a multiprocessing network
  (this attribute does not refer to SMP systems).  The scope is selected by the
  mutually exclusive ${../../attr/if/local:/name} and
  ${../../attr/if/global:/name} attributes.

  * A **local scope** is the default and can be emphasized through the use of
    the ${../../attr/if/local:/name} attribute.  A local partition can be only
    used by the node which created it.

  * A **global scope** is established if the ${../../attr/if/global:/name}
    attribute is set.  The memory space used for the partition must reside in
    shared memory.  Setting the global attribute in a single node system has no
    effect.

notes: |
  The partition buffer area specified by the ${.:/params[1]/name} must be
  properly aligned.  It must be possible to directly store target architecture
  pointers and also the user data.  For example, if the user data contains some
  long double or vector data types, the partition buffer area and the buffer
  size must take the alignment of these types into account which is usually
  larger than the pointer alignment.  A cache line alignment may be also a
  factor.  Use ${alignment:/name} to specify the minimum alignment of a
  partition buffer type.

  The ${.:/params[3]/name} parameter must be an integral multiple of the
  pointer size on the target architecture.  Additionally,
  ${.:/params[3]/name} must be large enough to hold two pointers on the
  target architecture.  This is required for RTEMS to manage the buffers when
  they are free.

  For control and maintenance of the partition, RTEMS allocates a
  ${/glossary/ptcb:/term} from the local PTCB free pool and initializes it.
  Memory from the partition buffer area is not used by RTEMS to store the PTCB.

  The PTCB for a global partition is allocated on the local node.  Partitions
  should not be made global unless remote tasks must interact with the
  partition.  This is to avoid the overhead incurred by the creation of a
  global partition.  When a global partition is created, the partition's name
  and identifier must be transmitted to every node in the system for insertion
  in the local copy of the global object table.
