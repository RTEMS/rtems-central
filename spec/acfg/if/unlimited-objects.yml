notes: |
  When using unlimited objects, it is common practice to also specify
  ${unified-work-areas:/name} so the system operates with a single pool
  of memory for both RTEMS Workspace and C Program Heap.

  This option does not override an explicit configuration for a particular
  object class by the user.

  See also ${unlimited-allocation-size:/name}.
