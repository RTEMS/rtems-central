  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while a task waits for
  events, while the measurement sample is the runtime of exactly one successful
  call to ${../if/send:/name} which does satisfy the event condition of the
  waiting task which does not preempt the caller, when exactly
  ${../val/perf:/params/sample-count} samples are collected, the
  ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
