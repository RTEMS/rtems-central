  brief: |
    Set the measured runtime.  Discard samples interrupted by a clock tick.

  Let U and V be two tasks with the same home scheduler.  Let :math:`B`
  be a time point measured by U right before a call to ${../if/send:/name}
  which unblocks the waiting task V which does preempt the caller.  Let
  :math:`E` be a time point measured by V right after the first context
  switch after :math:`B`.

  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while a message queue
  is empty, while only task V waits on the message queue, while the
  measurement sample is :math:`E - B`, when exactly
  ${../val/perf:/params/sample-count} samples are collected, the
  ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
