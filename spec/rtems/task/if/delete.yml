notes: |
  RTEMS stops the execution of the task and reclaims the stack memory, any
  allocated delay or timeout timers, the TCB, and, if the task is
  ${../../attr/if/floating-point:/name}, its floating point context area.
  RTEMS explicitly does not reclaim the following resources: region segments,
  partition buffers, semaphores, timers, or rate monotonic periods.

  A task is responsible for releasing its resources back to RTEMS before
  deletion.  To insure proper deallocation of resources, a task should not be
  deleted unless it is unable to execute or does not hold any RTEMS resources.
  If a task holds RTEMS resources, the task should be allowed to deallocate its
  resources before deletion.  A task can be directed to release its resources
  and delete itself by restarting it with a special argument or by sending it a
  message, an event, or a signal.

  Deletion of the current task (${self-define:/name}) will force RTEMS to
  select another task to execute.

  The ${/glossary/tcb:/term} for the deleted task is reclaimed by RTEMS.

  When a global task is deleted, the task identifier must be transmitted to
  every node in the system for deletion from the local copy of the global
  object table.

  The task must reside on the local node, even if the task was created with the
  ${../../attr/if/global:/name} attribute.
