notes: |
  The exact functionality of the driver entry called by this directive is
  driver dependent.  It should not be assumed that the control entries of two
  device drivers are compatible.  For example, an RS-232 driver I/O control
  operation may change the baud rate of a serial line, while an I/O control
  operation for a floppy disk driver may cause a seek operation.
