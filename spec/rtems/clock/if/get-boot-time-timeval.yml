  See ${get-boot-time:/name} and ${get-boot-time-bintime:/name} to get the boot
  time in alternative formats.  Setting the ${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term}
  will also set the boot time.

    is the pointer to a ${/c/if/timeval:/name} object.  The time elapsed since
    the ${/glossary/unix-epoch:/term} at some time point during system
    initialization call will be stored in this object.  Calling the directive
    with a pointer equal to ${/c/if/null:/name} is undefined behaviour.
