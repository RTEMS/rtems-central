  From the GNU C compiler documentation:
  The operand of ${../if/typeof-refx:/params[1]/name} is evaluated for
  its side effects if and only if it is an expression of variably
  modified type or the name of such a type.

  When the argument value of ${../if/typeof-refx:/params[0]/name} consists
  of a sequence of *i* ``*`` and the type of the other argument
  has *i* or less than *i* nested pointers
  (for example ``*`` for a pointer to ``int``,
  ``**`` for a pointer to a pointer of ``int``, ``***`` for a pointer to
  a pointer to a pointer to ``int``),
  and ${../if/typeof-refx:/params[1]/name} is either a pointer type
  (possibly with qualifiers) or an expression of such a pointer type,
  the macro ${../if/typeof-refx:/name} shall result in a type expression
  which is the type of argument ${../if/typeof-refx:/params[1]/name}
  with the given number of pointers removed.
