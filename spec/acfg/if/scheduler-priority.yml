notes: |
  This scheduler configuration option is an advanced configuration option.
  Think twice before you use it.

  In case no explicit ${/doc/if/config-scheduler-clustered:/name}
  is present, then it is used as the scheduler for exactly one processor.

  This scheduler algorithm is the default when
  ${max-processors:/name} is
  exactly one.

  The memory allocated for this scheduler depends on the
  ${max-priority:/name} configuration option.
