notes: |
  The ${.:/params[0]/name} parameter value must be obtained by a previous
  call to ${disable:/name} or ${flash:/name}.  Using an otherwise obtained
  value is undefined behaviour.

  This directive is unsuitable to enable particular interrupt sources, for
  example in an interrupt controller.
