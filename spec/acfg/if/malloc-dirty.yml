  In case this configuration option is defined, then each memory area returned
  by C Program Heap allocator functions such as ${/c/if/malloc:/name} is dirtied
  with a ``0xCF`` byte pattern before it is handed over to the application.

  The dirtying performed by this option is carried out for each successful

  ${dirty-memory:/name} which dirties the memory only once during the
