  This directive obtains the semaphore identifier associated with the semaphore
  name specified in ${.:/params[0]/name}.

  The node to search is specified in ${.:/params[1]/name}.  It shall be

  * a valid node number,

  * the constant ${../../object/if/search-all-nodes:/name} to search in all nodes,

  * the constant ${../../object/if/search-local-node:/name} to search in the local
    node only, or

  * the constant ${../../object/if/search-other-nodes:/name} to search in all nodes
    except the local node.

notes: |
  If the semaphore name is not unique, then the semaphore identifier will match
  the first semaphore with that name in the search order.  However, this
  semaphore identifier is not guaranteed to correspond to the desired
  semaphore.  The semaphore identifier is used with other semaphore related
  directives to access the semaphore.

  If node is ${../../object/if/search-all-nodes:/name}, all nodes are searched with
  the local node being searched first.  All other nodes are searched with the
  lowest numbered node searched first.

  If node is a valid node number which does not represent the local node, then
  only the semaphores exported by the designated node are searched.

  This directive does not generate activity on remote nodes.  It accesses only
  the local copy of the global object table.
