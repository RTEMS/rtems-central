appl-config-option-data-type: |
  Boolean feature macro.
appl-config-option-default-value: |
  By default, the memory used by the RTEMS Workspace and the C Program Heap
  is uninitialized memory.
appl-config-option-description: |
  This macro indicates whether RTEMS should dirty the memory used by the
  RTEMS Workspace and the C Program Heap as part of its initialization.  If
  defined, the memory areas are dirtied with a ``0xCF`` byte pattern.
  Otherwise, they are not.
appl-config-option-index: []
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_DIRTY_MEMORY
appl-config-option-notes: |
  Dirtying memory can add significantly to system boot time.  It may assist in
  finding code that incorrectly assumes the contents of free memory areas is
  cleared to zero during system initialization.  In case
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_ZERO_WORKSPACE_AUTOMATICALLY` is also defined, then the
  memory is first dirtied and then zeroed.
appl-config-option-range: |
  Defined or undefined.
