notes: |
  This scheduler configuration option is an advanced configuration option.
  Think twice before you use it.

  This scheduler algorithm is only available when RTEMS is built with SMP
  support enabled.

  In case no explicit ${/doc/if/config-scheduler-clustered:/name}
  is present, then it is used as the scheduler for up to 32 processors.

  The memory allocated for this scheduler depends on the
  ${max-priority:/name} configuration option.
