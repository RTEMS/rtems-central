  In case

  * this configuration option is defined

  * and ${record-per-processor-items:/name} is properly defined,

  then the event records are compressed by zlib and dumped in Base64 encoding
  in a fatal error extension (see ${/doc/if/terminate:/name}).

  The zlib compression needs about 512KiB of RAM.  This extension can be used
