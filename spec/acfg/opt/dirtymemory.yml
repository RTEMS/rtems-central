  In case this configuration option is defined, then the memory areas used for
  the RTEMS Workspace and the C Program Heap are dirtied with a ``0xCF`` byte
  pattern during system initialization.

appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_DIRTY_MEMORY
appl-config-option-notes: |
  Dirtying memory can add significantly to system initialization time.  It may
  assist in finding code that incorrectly assumes the contents of free memory
  areas is cleared to zero during system initialization.  In case
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_ZERO_WORKSPACE_AUTOMATICALLY` is also defined, then the
  memory is first dirtied and then zeroed.

  See also :ref:`CONFIGURE_MALLOC_DIRTY`.
