  This structure shall be treated as an opaque data type from the
  ${/glossary/api:/term} point of view.  Members shall not be accessed
  directly.  A request is initialized by ${server-request-initialize:/name} and
  destroyed by ${server-request-destroy:/name}.  The interrupt vector of the
  request can be set by ${server-request-set-vector:/name}.  The request is
  submitted to be serviced by ${server-request-submit:/name}.
