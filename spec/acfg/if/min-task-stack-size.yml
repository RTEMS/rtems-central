notes: |
  Adjusting this parameter should be done with caution.  Examining the actual
  stack usage using the stack checker usage reporting facility is recommended
  (see also ${stack-checker-enabled:/name}).

  This parameter can be used to lower the minimum from that recommended. This
  can be used in low memory systems to reduce memory consumption for
  stacks. However, this shall be done with caution as it could increase the
  possibility of a blown task stack.

  This parameter can be used to increase the minimum from that
  recommended. This can be used in higher memory systems to reduce the risk
  of stack overflow without performing analysis on actual consumption.

  By default, this configuration parameter defines also the minimum stack
  size of POSIX threads.  This can be changed with the
  ${min-posix-thread-stack-size:/name}
  configuration option.

  In releases before RTEMS 5.1 the ``CONFIGURE_MINIMUM_TASK_STACK_SIZE`` was
  used to define the default value of ${interrupt-stack-size:/name}.
