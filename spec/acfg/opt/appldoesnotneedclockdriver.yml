notes: |
  This configuration parameter is intended to prevent the common user error
  of using the Hello World example as the baseline for an application and
  leaving out a clock tick source.

  The application shall define exactly one of the following configuration options

  * :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CLOCK_DRIVER`,

  * `CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_DOES_NOT_NEED_CLOCK_DRIVER`, or

  * :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_TIMER_DRIVER`,

  otherwise a compile time error in the configuration file will occur.
