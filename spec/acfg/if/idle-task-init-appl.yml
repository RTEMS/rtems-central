  If this configuration option is undefined, then the user is assumed to
  provide one or more initialization tasks.
description: |
  This configuration option is defined to indicate that the user has configured
  **no** user initialization tasks or threads and that the user provided IDLE
  task will perform application initialization and then transform itself into
  an IDLE task.

notes: |
  If you use this option be careful, the user IDLE task **cannot** block at all
  during the initialization sequence.  Further, once application
  initialization is complete, it shall make itself preemptible and enter an idle
  body loop.

  The IDLE task shall run at the lowest priority of all tasks in the system.

  If this configuration option is defined, then it is mandatory to configure a
  user IDLE task with the ${idle-task-body:/name} configuration option,
  otherwise a compile time error in the configuration file will occur.

  The application shall define at least one of the following configuration
  options

  * ${rtems-init-tasks-table:/name},

  * ${posix-init-thread-table:/name}, or

  * ``CONFIGURE_IDLE_TASK_INITIALIZES_APPLICATION``

  otherwise a compile time error in the configuration file will occur.

  If no Classic API initialization task and no POSIX API initialization thread
  is configured, then no ${/doc/if/global-construction:/name} is performed.
