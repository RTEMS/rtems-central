  When argument ${../if/buffer:/params[0]/name} is the size of
  the largest possible message in bytes
  (the same value as member ${../if/config:/definition[2]/default/name} of type
  ${../if/config:/name}),
  and ``MAXIMUM_PENDING_MESSAGES`` is the maximum number of messages
  which can be stored in the message queue
  (the same value as member ${../if/config:/definition[1]/default/name} of type
  ${../if/config:/name}),
  and ``storage_area`` is a variable or structure member,
  the expression
  ``${../if/buffer:/name}(`` ``${../if/buffer:/params[0]/name} )``
  ``storage_area[`` ``MAXIMUM_PENDING_MESSAGES ]``
  shall declare an object of such a size that a pointer to it
  is usable as value for member ${../if/config:/definition[3]/default/name}
  of type ${../if/config:/name}.
