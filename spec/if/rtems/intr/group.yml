  Any real-time executive must provide a mechanism for quick response to
  externally generated interrupts to satisfy the critical time constraints of
  the application.  The Interrupt Manager provides this mechanism for RTEMS.
  This manager permits quick interrupt response times by providing the critical
  ability to alter task execution which allows a task to be preempted upon exit
  from an ISR.
