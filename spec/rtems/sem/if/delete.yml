notes: |
  Binary semaphores with an owner cannot be deleted.
  
  When a semaphore is deleted, all tasks blocked waiting to obtain the
  semaphore will be readied and returned a status code which indicates that the
  semaphore was deleted.

  The ${/glossary/smcb:/term} for the deleted semaphore is reclaimed by RTEMS.

  When a global semaphore is deleted, the semaphore identifier must be
  transmitted to every node in the system for deletion from the local copy of
  the global object table.

  The semaphore must reside on the local node, even if the semaphore was
  created with the ${../../attr/if/global:/name} attribute.

  Proxies, used to represent remote tasks, are reclaimed when the semaphore is
  deleted.
