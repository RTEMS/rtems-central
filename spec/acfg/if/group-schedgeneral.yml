  This section describes configuration options related to selecting a
  scheduling algorithm for an application.  A scheduler configuration is optional
  and only necessary in very specific circumstances.  A normal application
  configuration does not need any of the configuration options described in this
  section.

  By default, the ${.:/document-reference/scheduler-priority}
  algorithm is used in uniprocessor configurations.  In case SMP is enabled and
  the configured maximum processors
  (${max-processors:/name}) is greater
  than one, then the
  ${.:/document-reference/scheduler-smp-edf}
  is selected as the default scheduler algorithm.

  For the schedulers provided by RTEMS (see ${.:/document-reference/scheduler-concepts}), the
  configuration is straightforward.  All that is required is to define the
  configuration option which specifies which scheduler you want for in your
  application.

  The pluggable scheduler interface also enables the user to provide their own
  scheduling algorithm.  If you choose to do this, you must define multiple
  configuration option.
