  This directive returns the segment specified by ${.:/params[1]/name} to the
  region specified by ${.:/params[0]/name}.  The returned segment is merged
  with its neighbors to form the largest possible segment.  The first task on
  the wait queue is examined to determine if its segment request can now be
  satisfied.  If so, it is given a segment and unblocked.  This process is
  repeated until the first task's segment request cannot be satisfied.

  This directive will cause the calling task to be preempted if one or more
  local tasks are waiting for a segment and the following conditions exist:

  * A waiting task has a higher priority than the calling task.

  * The size of the segment required by the waiting task is less than or equal
    to the size of the segment returned.
