term: Strong APA
text: |
  Strong APA is a specialization of ${apa:/term}.  Schedulers which implement
  strong APA recursively searches for a processor in the ${thread:/term}'s
  affinity set, whenever a thread becomes ready for execution, followed by the
  processors in the affinity set of threads that are assigned the processor
  present in the ready thread's affinity set. This is done to find a thread to
  processor mapping that does not violate the priority ordering and to provide
  a thread to processor mapping with a higher total priority of the threads
  allocated a processor.  Similar analysis is done when a thread blocks.  See
  also :cite:`Cerqueira:2014:LPA`.
