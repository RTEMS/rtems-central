  This project uses the
  `thread definition of Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)>`_:
  "a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed
  instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is
  typically a part of the operating system."

  It consists normally of a set of registers and a stack.  The scheduler
  assigns processors to a subset of the ready tasks.  The terms task and
  @term{RTEMS-GLOS-TERM-THREAD} are synonym in RTEMS.  The term task is used
  throughout the Classic API, however, internally in the operating system
  implementation and the POSIX API the term thread is used.

  A *task* is a @term{RTEMS-GLOS-TERM-SOFTWARECOMPONENT}.
