  The Benchmark Timer Driver is intended for the benchmark tests of the RTEMS
  Testsuite.  Applications should not use this driver.

  The application shall define exactly one of the following configuration options

  * ${appl-needs-clock-driver:/name},

  * ${appl-does-not-need-clock-driver:/name}, or

  * ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_TIMER_DRIVER``,

  otherwise a compile time error will occur.
