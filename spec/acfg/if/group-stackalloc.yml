  This section describes configuration options related to the task stack
  allocator.  RTEMS allows the application or BSP to define its own allocation
  and deallocation methods for task stacks. This can be used to place task stacks
  in special areas of memory or to utilize a Memory Management Unit so that stack
  overflows are detected in hardware.
