notes: |
  There are no alignment requirements for the memory area.  The memory area
  must be big enough to contain some maintenance blocks.  It must not overlap
  parts of the current heap memory areas.  Disconnected memory areas added to
  the heap will lead to used blocks which cover the gaps.  Extending with an
  inappropriate memory area will corrupt the heap resulting in undefined
  behaviour.
