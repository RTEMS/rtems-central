term: extension reverse order
text: |
  The ${userextensions:/term} may be invoked in extension reverse order.  In
  reverse order, all user extensions of the ${dynamic-extension-sets:/term} are
  invoked before all user extensions of the ${initial-extension-sets:/term}.
  In the dynamic extension sets the order is defined by the registration order.
  The last registered user extension is invoked first.  In the initial
  extension sets the order is defined by the table index.  The user extension
  with the highest table index is invoked first.  See also
  ${extension-forward-order:/term}.
