notes: |
  This object class can be configured in unlimited allocation mode, see
  ${/doc/if/config-unlimited-objects:/name}.

  The calculations for the required memory in the RTEMS Workspace for tasks
  assume that each task has a minimum stack size and has floating point
  support enabled.  The configuration option ${extra-task-stacks:/name} is used
  to specify task stack requirements *above* the minimum size required.

  The maximum number of POSIX threads is specified by
  ${max-posix-threads:/name}.

  A future enhancement to ``<rtems/confdefs.h>`` could be to eliminate the
  assumption that all tasks have floating point enabled. This would require
  the addition of a new configuration parameter to specify the number of
  tasks which enable floating point support.
