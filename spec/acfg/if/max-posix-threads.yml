notes: |
  This object class can be configured in unlimited allocation mode, see
  ${.:/document-reference/config-unlimited-objects}.

  This calculations for the required memory in the RTEMS Workspace for threads
  assume that each thread has a minimum stack size and has floating point
  support enabled.  The configuration option ${extra-task-stacks:/name} is used
  to specify thread stack requirements **above** the minimum size required.

  The maximum number of Classic API Tasks is specified by
  ${max-tasks:/name}.

  All POSIX threads have floating point enabled.
