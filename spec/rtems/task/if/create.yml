  This directive creates a task which resides on the local node. It allocates
  and initializes a TCB, a stack, and an optional floating point context area.
  The mode parameter contains values which sets the taskâ€™s initial execution
  mode. The RTEMS_FLOATING_POINT attribute should be specified if the created
  task is to use a numeric coprocessor. For performance reasons, it is
  recommended that tasks not using the numeric coprocessor should specify the
  RTEMS_NO_FLOATING_POINT attribute. If the RTEMS_GLOBAL attribute is
  specified, the task can be accessed from remote nodes. The task id, returned
  in id, is used in other task related directives to access the task. When
  created, a task is placed in the dormant state and can only be made ready to
  execute using the directive rtems_task_start().
