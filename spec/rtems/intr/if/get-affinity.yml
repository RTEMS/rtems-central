    is the pointer to a ${/c/if/cpu_set_t:/name} object.  When the directive
    call is successful, the processor affinity set of the interrupt vector will
    be stored in this object.  A set bit in the processor set means that the
    corresponding processor is in the processor affinity set of the interrupt
    vector, otherwise the bit is cleared.
