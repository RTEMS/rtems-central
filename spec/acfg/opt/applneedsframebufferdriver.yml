  In case this configuration option is defined, then the Frame Buffer Driver is
  initialized during system initialization.

appl-config-option-notes: |
  Most BSPs do not include support for a Frame Buffer Driver. This is
  because many boards do not include the required hardware.

  If this option is defined and the BSP does not have this device driver, then
  the user will get a link time error for an undefined symbol.
