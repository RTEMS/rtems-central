  A timer in inactive ${../glossary/state:/term} will not
  ${../glossary/fire:/term} nor invoke its
  ${../glossary/timerserviceroutine:/term}. To change the
  ${../glossary/state:/term} the timer must be ${../glossary/scheduled:/term}. A
  timer enters inactive ${../glossary/state:/term} after

  * being created by a call to ${../if/create:/name}
  * being canceled by a call to ${../if/cancel:/name}
  * the ${../glossary/timerserviceroutine:/term} was invoked (the execution may still be ongoing).
