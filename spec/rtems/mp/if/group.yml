description: |
  In multiprocessor real-time systems, new requirements, such as sharing data
  and global resources between processors, are introduced.  This requires an
  efficient and reliable communications vehicle which allows all processors to
  communicate with each other as necessary.  In addition, the ramifications of
  multiple processors affect each and every characteristic of a real-time
  system, almost always making them more complicated.

  RTEMS addresses these issues by providing simple and flexible real-time
  multiprocessing capabilities.  The executive easily lends itself to both
  tightly-coupled and loosely-coupled configurations of the target system
  hardware.  In addition, RTEMS supports systems composed of both homogeneous
  and heterogeneous mixtures of processors and target boards.

  A major design goal of the RTEMS executive was to transcend the physical
  boundaries of the target hardware configuration.  This goal is achieved by
  presenting the application software with a logical view of the target system
  where the boundaries between processor nodes are transparent.  As a result,
  the application developer may designate objects such as tasks, queues,
  events, signals, semaphores, and memory blocks as global objects.  These
  global objects may then be accessed by any task regardless of the physical
  location of the object and the accessing task.  RTEMS automatically
  determines that the object being accessed resides on another processor and
  performs the actions required to access the desired object.  Simply stated,
  RTEMS allows the entire system, both hardware and software, to be viewed
  logically as a single system.
