  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and the ${../if/warn-unused-result:/name} macro is used as last part
  of a function declaration or attached to a function definition,
  and that function has a return type other than ``void``,
  and the returned value is not used,
  the macro shall cause the compiler to show a compiler warning.
