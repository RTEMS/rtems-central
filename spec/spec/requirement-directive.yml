      This set of attributes specifies functional requirements and
      corresponding validation tests for a directive.  A directive is a
      function or a macro.  There shall be exactly one link with the
      ${interface-function-role:/spec-name} to the interface of the directive.
      The directive requirement specifies

      * a list of pre-conditions, each with a set of states,

      * a list of post-conditions, each with a set of states,

      * the transition of pre-condition states to post-condition states through
        a call of the directive, and

      * the test code to generate a validation test.

      For a directive requirement it is verified that all variations of
      pre-condition states have a set of post-condition states specified in the
      transition map.
