  This section describes multiprocessing related configuration options.  The
  options are only used if RTEMS was built with the ``--enable-multiprocessing``
  build configuration option.  Additionally, this class of configuration options
  are only applicable if the configuration option :ref:`CONFIGURE_MP_APPLICATION`
  is defined.  The multiprocessing (MPCI) support must not be confused with the
  SMP support.
