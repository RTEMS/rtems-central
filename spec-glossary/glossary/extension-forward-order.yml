term: extension forward order
text: |
  The ${userextensions:/term} may be invoked in extension forward order.  In
  forward order, all user extensions of the ${initial-extension-sets:/term} are
  invoked before all user extensions of the ${dynamic-extension-sets:/term}.
  In the initial extension sets the order is defined by the table index.  The
  user extension with the lowest table index is invoked first.  In the dynamic
  extension sets the order is defined by the registration order.  The first
  registered user extension is invoked first.  See also
  ${extension-reverse-order:/term}.
