notes: |
  This object class can be configured in unlimited allocation mode, see
  :ref:`ConfigUnlimitedObjects`.

  Named semaphores are created with :c:func:`sem_open()`.  Semaphores
  initialized with :c:func:`sem_init()` are not affected by this configuration
  option since the storage space for these semaphores is user-provided.
