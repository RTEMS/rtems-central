  This directive obtains the message queue identifier associated with the
  message queue name specified in ``${.:/params[0]/name}``.

  The node to search is specified in ``${.:/params[1]/name}``.  It shall be

  * a valid node number,

  * the constant ${../../object/if/search-all-nodes:/name} to search in all nodes,

  * the constant ${../../object/if/search-local-node:/name} to search in the local
    node only, or

  * the constant ${../../object/if/search-other-nodes:/name} to search in all nodes
    except the local node.

notes: |
  If the message queue name is not unique, then the message queue identifier
  will match the first message queue with that name in the search order.
  However, this message queue identifier is not guaranteed to correspond to the
  desired message queue.  The message queue identifier is used with other
  message related directives to access the message queue.

  If node is ${../../object/if/search-all-nodes:/name}, all nodes are searched with
  the local node being searched first.  All other nodes are searched with the
  lowest numbered node searched first.

  If node is a valid node number which does not represent the local node, then
  only the message queues exported by the designated node are searched.

  This directive does not generate activity on remote nodes.  It accesses only
  the local copy of the global object table.
