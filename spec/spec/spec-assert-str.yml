        description: |
          The *and* operator evaluates to the *logical and* of the evaluation
          results of the expressions in the list.
        spec-type: spec-assert-str-list
      contains:
        description: |
          The *contains* operator evaluates to true, if the string to check
          converted to lower case with all white space characters converted to
          a single space character contains a string of the list of strings of
          this attribute, otherwise to false.

      eq:
        description: |
          The *eq* operator evaluates to true, if the string to check is equal
          to the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: str
      ge:
        description: |
          The *ge* operator evaluates to true, if the string to check is
          greater than or equal to the value of this attribute, otherwise to
          false.
        spec-type: str
      gt:
        description: |
          The *gt* operator evaluates to true, if the string to check is
          greater than the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: str
      in:
        description: |
          The *in* operator evaluates to true, if the string to check is
          contained in the list of strings of this attribute, otherwise to
          false.
        spec-type: list-str
      le:
        description: |
          The *le* operator evaluates to true, if the string to check is less
          than or equal to the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: str
      lt:
        description: |
          The *lt* operator evaluates to true, if the string to check is less
          than the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: str
      ne:
        description: |
          The *ne* operator evaluates to true, if the string to check is not
          equal to the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: str
      not:
        description: |
          The *not* operator evaluates to the *logical not* of the evaluation
          results of the expression.

      or:
        description: |
          The *or* operator evaluates to the *logical or* of the evaluation
          results of the expressions in the list.
        spec-type: spec-assert-str-list
      re:
        description: |
          The *re* operator evaluates to true, if the string to check matches
          with the regular expression of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: str
      uid:
        description: |
          The *uid* operator evaluates to true, if the string is a valid UID,
