notes: |
  In case this configuration option is defined, then the following
  configuration options will be defined as well

  * ${imfs-disable-chmod:/name},

  * ${imfs-disable-chown:/name},

  * ${imfs-disable-link:/name},

  * ${imfs-disable-mknod-file:/name},

  * ${imfs-disable-mount:/name},

  * ${imfs-disable-readdir:/name},

  * ${imfs-disable-readlink:/name},

  * ${imfs-disable-rename:/name},

  * ${imfs-disable-rmnod:/name},

  * ${imfs-disable-symlink:/name},

  * ${imfs-disable-utime:/name}, and

  * ${imfs-disable-unmount:/name}.

  In addition, a simplified path evaluation is enabled.  It allows only a look
  up of absolute paths.

  This configuration of the IMFS is basically a device-only filesystem.  It is
  comparable in functionality to the pseudo-filesystem name space provided
  before RTEMS release 4.5.0.
