  This structure shall be treated as an opaque data type from the
  ${/glossary/api:/term} point of view.  Members shall not be accessed
  directly.  An entry is initialized by ${server-entry-initialize:/name} and
  destroyed by ${server-entry-destroy:/name}.  Interrupt server actions can be
  prepended to the entry by ${server-action-prepend:/name}.  The entry is
  submitted to be serviced by ${server-entry-submit:/name}.
