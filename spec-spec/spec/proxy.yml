      Items of similar characteristics may link to a proxy item through links
      with the ${proxy-member:/spec-name}.  A proxy item resolves to the first
      member item which is enabled.  Proxies may be used to provide an
      interface with a common name and implementations which depend on
      configuration options.  For example, in one configuration a constant
      could be a compile time constant and in another configuration it could be
      a read-only object.
