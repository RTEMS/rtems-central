  This directive returns the statistics of the rate monotonic period specified
  by ${.:/params[0]/name}.  The statistics of the period will be returned in
  the members of the period statistics object referenced by
  ${.:/params[1]/name}:

  * The ``count`` member is set to the number of periods executed.

  * The ``missed_count`` member is set to the number of periods missed.

  * The ``min_cpu_time`` member is set to the least amount of processor time
    used in the period.

  * The ``max_cpu_time`` member is set to the highest amount of processor time
    used in the period.

  * The ``total_cpu_time`` member is set to the total amount of processor time
    used in the period.

  * The ``min_wall_time`` member is set to the least amount of
    ${/glossary/clock-monotonic:/term} time used in the period.

  * The ``max_wall_time`` member is set to the highest amount of
    ${/glossary/clock-monotonic:/term} time used in the period.

  * The ``total_wall_time`` member is set to the total amount of
    ${/glossary/clock-monotonic:/term} time used in the period.
