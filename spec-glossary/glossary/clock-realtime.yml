  The CLOCK_REALTIME is a clock provided by RTEMS which measures the real time
  (also known as wall-clock time).  It is defined by ${posix:/term}.  In
  particular, every day is treated as if it contains exactly 86400 seconds and
  leap seconds are ignored.  This clock can be set by the application which may
  result in time jumps.  It may be affected by incremental adjustments for
  example carried out by the ${ntp:/term} or the use of a ${pps:/term} signal.
  RTEMS can represent time points of this clock in nanoseconds ranging from
  1988-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z to 2514-05-31T01:53:03.999999999Z.  See also
  ${clock-monotonic:/term}, ${clock-tick:/term}, and ${clock-driver:/term}.
