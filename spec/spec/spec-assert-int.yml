spec-description: |
  A value of this type shall be an expression which asserts that the integer
  value of the specified attribute satisfies the required constraints.
spec-example: null
spec-info:
  dict:
    attributes:
      and:
        description: |
          The *and* operator evaluates to the *logical and* of the evaluation
          results of the expressions in the list.
        spec-type: spec-assert-int-list
      eq:
        description: |
          The *eq* operator evaluates to true, if the value to check is equal
          to the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: int
      ge:
        description: |
          The *ge* operator evaluates to true, if the value to check is greater
          than or equal to the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: int
      gt:
        description: |
          The *gt* operator evaluates to true, if the value to check is greater
          than the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: int
      le:
        description: |
          The *le* operator evaluates to true, if the value to check is less
          than or equal to the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: int
      lt:
        description: |
          The *lt* operator evaluates to true, if the value to check is less
          than the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: int
      ne:
        description: |
          The *ne* operator evaluates to true, if the value to check is not
          equal to the value of this attribute, otherwise to false.
        spec-type: int
      not:
        description: |
          The *not* operator evaluates to the *logical not* of the evaluation
          results of the expression.
        spec-type: spec-assert-int
      or:
        description: |
          The *or* operator evaluates to the *logical or* of the evaluation
          results of the expressions in the list.
        spec-type: spec-assert-int-list
    description: |
      Each attribute defines an operator.
    required-attributes: exactly-one
  list:
    description: |
      This list of expressions evaluates to the *logical or* of the evaluation
      results of the expressions in the list.
