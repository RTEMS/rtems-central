  Boolean feature macro.
appl-config-option-default-value: |
  This is not defined by default.
appl-config-option-description: |
  ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_WATCHDOG_DRIVER`` is defined if the
  application wishes to include the Watchdog Driver.
appl-config-option-index: []
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_WATCHDOG_DRIVER
appl-config-option-notes: |
  Most BSPs do not include support for a watchdog device driver. This is
  because many boards do not include the required hardware.

  If this is defined and the BSP does not have this device driver, then the
  user will get a link time error for an undefined symbol.
appl-config-option-range: |
  Defined or undefined.
