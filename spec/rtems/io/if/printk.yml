  The directive may be used to print debug and test information.  It uses
  ${putc:/name} to output the characters.  This directive performs a character
  translation from ``NL`` to ``CR`` followed by ``NR``.

  If the kernel character output device is concurrently accessed, then
  interleaved output may occur.
