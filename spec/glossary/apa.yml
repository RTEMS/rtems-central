  This term is an acronym for Arbitrary Processor Affinity.  APA schedulers
  allow a thread to have an arbitrary affinity to a processor set, rather than
  a restricted mapping to only one processor of the set or the ability to run
  on all processors of the set.

  It has two variants, ${weakapa:/term} and ${strongapa:/term}.
