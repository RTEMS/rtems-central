  This directive may cause the calling task to be preempted due to an obtain

  This directive can be used to set the name of objects which do not have a
  naming scheme per their API.

  If the object specified by ``${.:/params[0]/name}`` is of a class that has a
  string name, this directive will free the existing name to the RTEMS Workspace
  and allocate enough memory from the RTEMS Workspace to make a copy of the
  string located at ``${.:/params[1]/name}``.

  If the object specified by ``${.:/params[0]/name}`` is of a class that has a
  32-bit integer style name, then the first four characters in
  ``${.:/params[1]/name}`` will be used to construct the name.
