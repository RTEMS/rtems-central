  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while a task waits for
  events, while the measurement sample is the runtime of exactly one successful
  call to ${../if/send:/name} which does not satisfy the event condition of the
  waiting task, when exactly ${../val/perf:/params/sample-count} samples are
  collected, the ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
