description: |
  This directive sends the event set, ${.:/params[1]/name}, to the target
  task identified by ${.:/params[0]/name}.  Based upon the state of the
  target task, one of the following situations applies:

  * The target task is blocked waiting for events, then

    * if the waiting task's input event condition is satisfied, then the task
      is made ready for execution, or

    * otherwise, the event set is posted but left pending and the task remains
      blocked.

  * The target task is not waiting for events, then the event set is posted and
    left pending.

notes: |
  Events can be sent by tasks or an ${/glossary/isr:/term}.

  Specifying ${../../task/if/self-define:/name} for ${.:/params[0]/name} results
  in the event set being sent to the calling task.

  The event set to send shall be built by a *bitwise or* of the desired events.
  The set of valid events is ${event-00:/name} through ${event-31:/name}.  If
  an event is not explicitly specified in the set, then it is not present.

  Identical events sent to a task are not queued.  In other words, the second,
  and subsequent, posting of an event to a task before it can perform an
  ${receive:/name} has no effect.

  The calling task will be preempted if it has preemption enabled and a higher
  priority task is unblocked as the result of this directive.

  Sending an event set to a global task which does not reside on the local node
  will generate a request telling the remote node to send the event set to the
  appropriate task.
