  This term is defined by ECSS-E-ST-40C 3.2.28 as a "part of a software
  system".  For this project a *software component* shall be any of the
  following items and nothing else:

  * ${softwareunit:/glossary-term}

  * explicitly defined ${elf:/glossary-term} symbol in a
    ${sourcecode:/glossary-term} file

  * ${assemblerlanguage:/glossary-term} data in a source code file

  * ${clanguage:/glossary-term} object with static storage duration

  * C language object with thread-local storage duration

  * ${thread:/glossary-term}

  * ${interruptservice:/glossary-term}

  * collection of *software components* (this is a software architecture
    element)

  Please note that explicitly defined ELF symbols and assembler language
  data are considered a software component only if they are defined in a
  ${sourcecode:/glossary-term} file.  For example, this rules out symbols
  and data generated as side-effects by the toolchain (compiler, assembler,
  linker) such as jump tables, linker trampolines, exception frame information,
  etc.
