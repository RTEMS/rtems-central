rationale: |
  Some directives with a task priority parameter ignore the priority value
  under specific circumstances, for example ${../if/set-priority:/name} may be
  used to get the current priority.  This constant may be used as a dummy task
  priority value to document that the priority parameter is unused.

  The ${../if/no-priority:/name} constant shall expand to a constant
  expression which evaluates to the value of
  ${../if/current-priority:/name}.
