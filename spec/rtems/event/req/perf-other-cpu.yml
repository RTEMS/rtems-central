  brief: |
    Send two events.  Satisfy the event condition.
  code: |
    ctx->begin = T_tick();
    ctx->status = rtems_event_send( ctx->worker_id, EVENT_END | EVENT_OTHER );

test-cleanup:
  brief: |
    Move worker to scheduler A.
  code: |
    SetScheduler( ctx->worker_id, SCHEDULER_A_ID, PRIO_HIGH );
  description: null
test-prepare:
  brief: |
    Move worker to scheduler B.
  code: |

test-setup: null
test-teardown:
  brief: |
    Set the measured runtime.  Make sure the worker waits for the next event.
    Discard samples interrupted by a clock tick.
  code: |
    T_quiet_rsc_success( ctx->status );

    *delta = ctx->end - ctx->begin;

  Let ``U` and `V`` be two tasks with distinct home schedulers.  Let :math:`B`
  be a time point measured by ``U`` right before a call to ${../if/send:/name}
  which does satisfy the event condition of the waiting task ``V`` which is
  scheduled on another processor.  Let :math:`E` be a time point measured by
  ``V`` right after the first context switch after :math:`B`.
  
  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while the task ``V``
  waits for events, while the measurement sample is :math:`E - B`, when exactly
  ${../val/perf:/params/sample-count} samples are collected, the
  ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
