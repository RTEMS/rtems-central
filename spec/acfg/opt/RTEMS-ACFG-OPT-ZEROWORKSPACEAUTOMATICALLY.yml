appl-config-option-data-type: |
  Boolean feature macro.
appl-config-option-default-value: |
  This is not defined by default.  The default is *NOT* to zero out the RTEMS
  Workspace or C Program Heap.
appl-config-option-description: |
  This macro indicates whether RTEMS should zero the RTEMS Workspace and C
  Program Heap as part of its initialization.  If defined, the memory regions
  are zeroed.  Otherwise, they are not.
appl-config-option-index:
- clear C Program Heap
- clear RTEMS Workspace
- zero C Program Heap
- zero RTEMS Workspace
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_ZERO_WORKSPACE_AUTOMATICALLY
appl-config-option-notes: |
  Zeroing memory can add significantly to system boot time. It is not
  necessary for RTEMS but is often assumed by support libraries.  In case
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_DIRTY_MEMORY` is also defined, then the memory is first
  dirtied and then zeroed.
appl-config-option-range: |
  Defined or undefined.
