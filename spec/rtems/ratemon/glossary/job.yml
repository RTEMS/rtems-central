  A job denotes the code which the ${../glossary/ownertask:/term} executes
  between two successive calls to ${../if/period:/name} (excluding those using
  ${../if/period-status-define:/name}).  A job starts when the first
  of these two ${../if/period:/name} calls returns.  A job ends with the next
  call to ${../if/period:/name} or a call to ${../if/cancel:/name} or
  ${../if/delete:/name}.
