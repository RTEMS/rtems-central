notes: |
    The date, time, and ticks specified by ${.:/params[0]/name} are all
    range-checked, and an error is returned if any one is out of its valid
    range.

    RTEMS can represent time points of the ${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term}
    clock in nanoseconds ranging from 1988-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z to
    2514-05-31T01:53:03.999999999Z.  The future uptime of the system shall be
    in this range, otherwise the system behaviour is undefined.  Due to
    implementation constraints, the time of day set by the directive shall be
    before 2100-01-01:00:00.000000000Z.  The latest valid time of day accepted
    by the POSIX ${/c/if/clock-settime:/name} is
    2400-01-01T00:00:00.999999999Z.

    The specified time is based on the configured ${/glossary/clock-tick:/term}
    rate, see the ${/acfg/if/microseconds-per-tick:/name} application
    configuration option.

    Setting the time forward will fire all ${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term}
    timers which are scheduled at a time point before or at the time set by the
    directive.  This may unblock tasks, which may preempt the calling task.
    User-provided timer routines will execute in the context of the caller.

    It is allowed to call this directive from within interrupt context,
    however, this is not recommended since an arbitrary number of timers may
    fire.

    The directive shall be called at least once to enable the service of
    ${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term} related directives.  If the clock is not
    set at least once, they may return an error status.
