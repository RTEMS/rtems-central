  A task is an heir if it is registered as an heir in a processor of the
  system.  A task can be the heir on at most one processor in the system.
  In case the executing and heir tasks differ on a processor and a thread
  dispatch is marked as necessary, then the next thread dispatch will make
  the heir task the executing task.
