notes: |
  The ${get-attributes:/name} directive may be used to check if the processor
  affinity of an interrupt vector can be set.

  Only online processors of the affinity set specified by ${.:/params[1]/name}
  and ${.:/params[2]/name} are considered by the directive.  Other processors
  of the set are ignored.  If the set contains no online processor, then the
  set is invalid and an error status is returned.
params:

    is the interrupt vector number.
  dir: null
  name: vector
- description: |
    is the size of the processor set referenced by ${.:/params[2]/name} in
    bytes.
  dir: null
  name: affinity_size
- description: |
    is the pointer to a ${/c/if/cpu_set_t:/name} object.  The processor set
    defines the new processor affinity set of the interrupt vector.  A set bit
    in the processor set means that the corresponding processor shall be in the
    processor affinity set of the interrupt vector, otherwise the bit shall be
    cleared.
