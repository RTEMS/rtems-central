notes: |
  This configuration parameter is intended to prevent the common user error
  of using the Hello World example as the baseline for an application and
  leaving out a clock tick source.

  The application shall define exactly one of the following configuration options

  * ${appl-needs-clock-driver:/name},

  * ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_DOES_NOT_NEED_CLOCK_DRIVER``, or

  * ${appl-needs-timer-driver:/name},

  otherwise a compile time error in the configuration file will occur.
