  The task start extensions are invoked in

  In SMP configurations, the thread may already run on another processor before
  the task start extensions are actually invoked.  Task switch and task begin
  extensions may run before or in parallel with the thread start extension in
  SMP configurations, see ${task-switch:/name} and ${task-begin:/name}.
