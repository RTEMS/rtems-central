notes: |
  This object class can be configured in unlimited allocation mode, see
  :ref:`ConfigUnlimitedObjects`.

  The calculations for the required memory in the RTEMS Workspace for tasks
  assume that each task has a minimum stack size and has floating point
  support enabled.  The configuration parameter
  ``CONFIGURE_EXTRA_TASK_STACKS`` is used to specify task stack requirements
  *ABOVE* the minimum size required.  See :ref:`Reserve Task/Thread Stack
  Memory Above Minimum` for more information about
  ``CONFIGURE_EXTRA_TASK_STACKS``.

  The maximum number of POSIX threads is specified by
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_POSIX_THREADS`.

  A future enhancement to ``<rtems/confdefs.h>`` could be to eliminate the
  assumption that all tasks have floating point enabled. This would require
  the addition of a new configuration parameter to specify the number of
  tasks which enable floating point support.
