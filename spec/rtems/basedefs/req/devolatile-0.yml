  When ${../if/devolatile:/params[0]/name} is a non-volatile pointer type,
  and ${../if/devolatile:/params[1]/name} is a pointer to a value of
  volatile type,
  and the types of ${../if/devolatile:/params[0]/name} and
  ${../if/devolatile:/params[1]/name} are compatible in the sense of C,
  the macro ${../if/devolatile:/name} shall result in an expression
  which returns a pointer of type ${../if/devolatile:/params[0]/name} pointing
  to the same address as ${../if/devolatile:/params[1]/name}.
type: requirement
