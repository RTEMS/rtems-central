  The GNU C compiler can optimize such a function without regard to what would
  happen if it ever did return. Declaring a function ${../if/no-return:/name}
  also avoids spurious warnings of uninitialized variables.

  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler starting at version 2.5
  or the ``__cplusplus`` symbol is defined with version ``201103L`` or higher
  or the ``__STDC_VERSION__`` symbol is defined with version ``201112L``
  or higher,
  and the ${../if/no-return:/name} macro is used as first part of a
  function declaration or definition,
  the ${../if/no-return:/name} macro shall
  inform the compiler that this function does not return when called.
