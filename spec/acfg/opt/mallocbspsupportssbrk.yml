  If

  * this configuration option is defined by the BSP

  * and :ref:`CONFIGURE_DISABLE_BSP_SETTINGS` is undefined,

  then not all memory is made available to the C Program Heap immediately at
  system initialization time.  When :c:func:`malloc()` or other standard memory
  allocation functions are unable to allocate memory, they will call the BSP
  supplied :c:func:`sbrk()` function to obtain more memory.

appl-config-option-notes: |
  This option should not be defined by the application. Only the BSP knows how
  it allocates memory to the C Program Heap.
