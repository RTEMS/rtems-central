  One of the following mutually exclusive options

  * ${unique:/name},

  * ${shared:/name}, and

  * ${replace:/name}

  shall be set in the ${.:/params[2]/name} parameter.

  The handler routine will be called with the argument specified by
  ${.:/params[4]/name} when dispatched.  The order in which shared
  interrupt handlers are dispatched for one vector is defined by the
  installation order.  The first installed handler is dispatched first.

  If the option ${unique:/name} is set, then it will be ensured that the
  handler will be the only one for the interrupt vector.

  If the option ${shared:/name} is set, then multiple handler may be installed
  for the interrupt vector.

  If the option ${replace:/name} is set, then the handler specified by
  ${.:/params[3]/name} will replace the first handler with the same argument
  for the interrupt vector if it exists, otherwise an error status will be
  returned.  A second handler with the same argument for the interrupt vector
  will remain unchanged.  The new handler will inherit the unique or shared
  options from the replaced handler.

  An informative description may be provided in ${.:/params[1]/name}.  It may
  be used for system debugging and diagnostic tools.  The referenced string has
  to be persistent as long as the handler is installed.
