notes: |
  This configuration option is independent of the other thread stack allocator
  configuration options.  It is assumed that any memory allocated for the task
  storage area of an ${/glossary/idletask:/term} will not be from the RTEMS
  Workspace.

  The IDLE task stack allocator may increase the size of the allocated memory
  area to account for the actually allocated memory area.

  The

  * ${idle-task-storage-size:/name}, and

  * ``CONFIGURE_TASK_STACK_ALLOCATOR_FOR_IDLE``

  configuration options are mutually exclusive.
