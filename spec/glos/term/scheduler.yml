  A scheduler or scheduling algorithm allocates processors to a subset of
  its set of ready tasks.  So it manages access to the processor resource.
  Various algorithms exist to choose the tasks allowed to use a processor
  out of the set of ready tasks.  One method is to assign each task a
  priority number and assign the tasks with the lowest priority number to
  one processor of the set of processors owned by a scheduler instance.
