    is the pointer to a ${/c/if/cpu_set_t:/name} object.  When the directive
    call is successful, the processor affinity set of the task will be stored
    in this object.  A set bit in the processor set means that the
    corresponding processor is in the processor affinity set of the task,
    otherwise the bit is cleared.
