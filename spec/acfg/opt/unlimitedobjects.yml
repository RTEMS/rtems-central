  In case this configuration option is defined, then unlimited objects are used
  by default.

appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_UNLIMITED_OBJECTS
appl-config-option-notes: |
  When using unlimited objects, it is common practice to also specify
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_UNIFIED_WORK_AREAS` so the system operates with a single pool
  of memory for both RTEMS Workspace and C Program Heap.

  This option does not override an explicit configuration for a particular
  object class by the user.

  See also :ref:`CONFIGURE_UNLIMITED_ALLOCATION_SIZE`.
