  This directive blocks the calling task for the specified ${.:/params[0]/name}
  of clock ticks if the value is not equal to ${yield-processor:/name}.  When
  the requested interval has elapsed, the task is made ready.  The clock tick
  directives automatically updates the delay period.  The calling task may give
  up the processor and remain in the ready state by specifying a value of
  ${yield-processor:/name} in ${.:/params[0]/name}.
