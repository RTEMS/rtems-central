notes: |
  If this configuration option is specified, then

  * a task storage area of the specified size is statically allocated by
    ${header-confdefs:/path} for the Classic API initialization task,

  * the Classic API initialization task is constructed by
    ${/rtems/task/if/construct:/name} instead of using
    ${/rtems/task/if/create:/name},

  * the maximum thread-local storage size defined by
    ${max-thread-local-storage-size:/name} is used for the Classic API
    initialization task,

  * the Classic API initialization task should be accounted for in
    ${min-tasks-with-user-provided-storage:/name}, and

  * the task storage area used for the Classic API initialization task is not
    reclaimed by the system if the task is deleted.

  The

  * ${init-task-stack-size:/name} and

  * ``CONFIGURE_INIT_TASK_CONSTRUCT_STORAGE_SIZE``

  configuration options are mutually exclusive.
