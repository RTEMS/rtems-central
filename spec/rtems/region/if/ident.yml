notes: |
  If the region name is not unique, then the region identifier will match the
  first region with that name in the search order.  However, this region
  identifier is not guaranteed to correspond to the desired region.

  The objects are searched from lowest to the highest index.  Only the local
  node is searched.

  The region identifier is used with other region related directives to access
  the region.
