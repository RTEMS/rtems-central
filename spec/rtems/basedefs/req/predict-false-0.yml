  Example: ``if ( ${../if/predict-false:/name}( -1 == i ) ) { ... }``.
  The GNU C compiler uses this information for branch optimization.
  ``builtin-expect-probability`` defaults to 90%.

  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and the ${../if/predict-false:/name} macro is used as a conditional
  in ``if``-expressions and loop expressions,
  and ${../if/predict-false:/params[0]/name} after undergoing all possible C
  pre-processor substitutions is an integral expression,
  the macro shall cause the compiler to assume that by the percentage of
  cases defined by ``builtin-expect-probability`` the expression evaluates
  to 0.
