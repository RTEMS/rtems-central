  A deadline is a point in time.  A sequence of deadlines each separated
  from the next by the exact period length (i.e. parameter
  ${../if/period:/params[1]/name}) form a theoretical ideal execution
  sequence of ${../glossary/interval:/plural} of a rate monotonic period.
  The return of the first call to ${../if/period:/name} which changes the
  ${../glossary/state:/term} from ${../glossary/inactive:/term} to
  ${../glossary/active:/term} defines the first deadline in this sequence.

  Ideally each ${../glossary/interval:/term} takes place between
  a start and an end deadline whereby the N-th
  ${../glossary/interval:/term} starts with the N-th deadline and ends
  with the (N+1)-th deadline.  Due to ${../glossary/postponedjob:/plural}
  and ${../glossary/expired:/term} ${../glossary/state:/plural}
  an ${../glossary/interval:/term} can be out-of-sync from this ideal
  deadline sequence.  In such a case it may start sometime after its
  start deadline or even start after its end deadline has passed.

  If the period is in ${../glossary/active:/term} ${../glossary/state:/term}
  and there are no ${../glossary/postponedjob:/plural}, the
  ${../glossary/interval:/term} end is synchronized with the ideal end
  deadline of the ${../glossary/interval:/term} by the
  ${../if/period:/name} directive not returning before that end deadline
  has passed.
