          It shall be a Python ``fnmatch`` pattern.  If a file path relative to

          It shall be a list of Python ``fnmatch`` patterns.  If a file path
          matches with the pattern, then the file is not added to the directory
          state.  The file paths are absolute paths relative to the base
          directory of the directory state.  For example, if the directory
          state has a base of ``/base`` and a file to include has the path
          ``/base/abc``, then the file path ``/abc`` is used to match with the
          exclude patterns.
