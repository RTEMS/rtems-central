rationale: |
  This case is for functions where the arguments are not available
  to be checked (such as ``vprintf``). The compiler will only check
  the format string for consistency.

  Counting of arguments starts at 1 from the left with the
  exception of non-static C++ methods where the counting starts with
  2 due to the implicit ``this`` argument.

  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and the ${../if/printflike:/name} macro is used as last part of a
  function declaration or prefixes a function definition,
  and ${../if/printflike:/params[0]/name} is a constant number
  referring to an argument of that function,
  and the function argument number ${../if/printflike:/params[0]/name}
  is a ``printf``-format string,
  and the function argument ${../if/printflike:/params[1]/name} is 0,
  the macro shall cause the compiler to use this information for
  checking the format string.
