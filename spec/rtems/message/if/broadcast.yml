  This directive causes all tasks that are waiting at the queue specified by
  ${.:/params[0]/name} to be unblocked and sent the message contained in
  ${.:/params[1]/name}.  Before a task is unblocked, the message
  ${.:/params[1]/name} of ${.:/params[2]/name} byes in length is copied to that
  task's message buffer.  The number of tasks that were unblocked is returned
  in ${.:/params[3]/name}.

notes: |
  The execution time of this directive is directly related to the number of
  tasks waiting on the message queue, although it is more efficient than the
  equivalent number of invocations of ${send:/name}.
params:

    is the queue identifier.

- description: |
    is the begin address of the message buffer to broadcast.

- description: |
    is the pointer to an ${/c/if/uint32_t:/name} object.  When the directive
    call is successful, the number of unblocked tasks will be stored in this
    object.
