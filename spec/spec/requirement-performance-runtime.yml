  The item shall have exactly one link with the
  ${runtime-measurement-request-role:/spec-name}.  A requirement text processor
  shall support a substitution of $${.:/limit-kind}:

  * For a ${requirement-performance-runtime-kind:/spec-name} of
    ``min-lower-bound`` or ``min-upper-bound``, the substitution of
    $${.:/limit-kind} shall be ``"minimum"``.

  * For a ${requirement-performance-runtime-kind:/spec-name} of
    ``mean-lower-bound`` or ``mean-upper-bound``, the substitution of
    $${.:/limit-kind} shall be ``"mean"``.

  * For a ${requirement-performance-runtime-kind:/spec-name} of
    ``max-lower-bound`` or ``max-upper-bound``, the substitution of
    $${.:/limit-kind} shall be ``"maximum"``.

  A requirement text processor shall support a substitution of
  $${.:/limit-condition}:

  * For a ${requirement-performance-runtime-kind:/spec-name} of
    ``min-lower-bound``, ``mean-lower-bound``, or ``max-lower-bound``, the
    substitution of $${.:/limit-condition} shall be ``"greater than or equal to
    <value>"`` with <value> being the value of the corresponding entry in the
    ${requirement-performance-runtime-values:/spec-name}.

  * For a ${requirement-performance-runtime-kind:/spec-name} of
    ``min-upper-bound``, ``mean-upper-bound``, or ``max-upper-bound``, the
    substitution of $${.:/limit-condition} shall be ``"less than or equal to
    <value>"`` with <value> being the value of the corresponding entry in the
    ${requirement-performance-runtime-values:/spec-name}.

  A requirement text processor shall support a substitution of
  $${.:/environment}.  The value of the substitution shall be ``"<environment>
  environment"`` with <environment> being the environment of the corresponding
  entry in the ${requirement-performance-runtime-envs:/spec-name}.
