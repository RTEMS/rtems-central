  If this configuration option is defined, then POSIX timers may not be created
  to use the ${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term}.  Per POSIX, this is allowed
  behavior but per the FACE Technical Standard, it is not. Using POSIX timers
  based on CLOCK_REALTIME (e.g., time of day) is unsafe for real-time safety
  systems as setting CLOCK_REALTIME will perturb any active timers.

  If this option is not defined, POSIX timers may be created to use the
  CLOCK_REALTIME in compliance with the POSIX specification.
