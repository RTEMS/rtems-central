notes: |
  This configuration option should only be used when it is suspected that a bug
  in ``<rtems/confdefs.h>`` has resulted in an underestimation.  Typically the
  memory allocation will be too low when an application does not account for
  all message queue buffers or task stacks, see
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_MESSAGE_BUFFER_MEMORY`.
