  This directive blocks the calling task for the specified ${.:/params[0]/name}
  count of clock ticks if the value is not equal to ${yield-processor:/name}.
  When the requested count of ticks have occurred, the task is made ready.  The
  clock tick directives automatically update the delay period.  The calling task
  may give up the processor and remain in the ready state by specifying a value
  of ${yield-processor:/name} in ${.:/params[0]/name}.

notes: |
  Setting the system date and time with the ${../../clock/if/set:/name}
  directive and similar directives which set ${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term}
  have no effect on a ${wake-after:/name} blocked task.  The delay until first
  clock tick will never be a whole clock tick interval since this directive will
  never excute exactly on a clock tick.  Applications requiring use of a clock
  (${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term} or ${/glossary/clock-monotonic:/term})
  instead of clock ticks should make use of ${/c/if/clock-nanosleep:/name}.
