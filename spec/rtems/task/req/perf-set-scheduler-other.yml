  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while the measurement
  sample is the runtime of exactly one successful call to
  ${../if/set-scheduler:/name} which moves the task to the home scheduler of
  the caller which does not preempt the caller, when exactly
  ${../val/perf:/params/sample-count} samples are collected, the
  ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
