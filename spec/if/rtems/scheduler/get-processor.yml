description: |
  In uniprocessor configurations, this macro evaluates to a compile time
  constant of zero.

  In SMP configurations, an architecture-specific method is used to obtain the
  index of the current processor in the system.  The set of processor indices
  is the range of integers starting with zero up to
  ${get-processor-maximum:/name} minus one.

notes: |
  Outside of sections with disabled thread dispatching the current processor
  index may change after every instruction since the thread may migrate from
  one processor to another.  Sections with disabled interrupts are sections
  with thread dispatching disabled.
