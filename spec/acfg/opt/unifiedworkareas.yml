  If this configuration option is undefined, then there will be separate memory
  pools for the RTEMS Workspace and C Program Heap.
appl-config-option-description: |
  In case this configuration option is defined, then the RTEMS Workspace and
  the C Program Heap will be one pool of memory.
appl-config-option-index:
- unified work areas
- separate work areas
- RTEMS Workspace
- C Program Heap

appl-config-option-notes: |
  Having separate pools does have some advantages in the event a task blows a
  stack or writes outside its memory area. However, in low memory systems the
  overhead of the two pools plus the potential for unused memory in either
  pool is very undesirable.

  In high memory environments, this is desirable when you want to use the
  :ref:`ConfigUnlimitedObjects` option.  You will be able to create objects
  until you run out of all available memory rather then just until you run out
  of RTEMS Workspace.
