  This directive initiates the timer specified by ${.:/params[0]/name}.  If the
  timer is running, it is automatically canceled before being initiated.  The
  timer is scheduled to fire after an interval of clock ticks has passed
  specified by ${.:/params[1]/name}.  When the timer fires, the timer service
  routine ${.:/params[2]/name} will be invoked with the argument
  ${.:/params[3]/name} in the context of the clock tick ${/glossary/isr:/term}.
