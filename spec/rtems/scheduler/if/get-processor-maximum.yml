  Where the system was built with SMP support disabled, this directive
  evaluates to a compile time constant of one.

  Where the system was built with SMP support enabled, this directive returns
  the minimum of the processors (physically or virtually) available at the
  ${/glossary/target:/term} and the configured processor maximum
  (see ${/acfg/if/max-processors:/name}).  Not all processors in the range from
  processor index zero to the last processor index (which is the processor
  maximum minus one) may be configured to be used by a scheduler or may be
  online (online processors have a scheduler assigned).
