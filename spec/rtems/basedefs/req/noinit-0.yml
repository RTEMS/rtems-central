  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and the ${../if/section:/name} macro is attached to a
  global variable definition,
  and the file format used supports arbitrary sections,
  the macro shall cause the compiler to store the
  variable in a section where its value is not initialized
  during initial start up.
