  If the value of this configuration option is greater than zero, then it
  defines the maximum thread-local storage size, otherwise the thread-local
  storage size is defined by the linker depending on the thread-local storage
  objects used by the application in the statically-linked executable.

notes: |
  This configuration option can be used to reserve space for the dynamic linking
  of modules with thread-local storage objects.

  If the thread-local storage size defined by the thread-local storage
  objects used by the application in the statically-linked executable is greater
  than a non-zero value of this configuration option, then a fatal error will
  occur during system initialization.

  Use ${/rtems/basedefs/if/align-up:/name} and
  ${/rtems/task/if/storage-alignment:/name} to adjust the size to meet the
  minimum alignment requirement of a thread-local storage area.

  The actual thread-local storage size is determined when the application
  executable is linked.  The ``rtems-exeinfo`` command line tool included in
  the RTEMS Tools can be used to obtain the thread-local storage size and
  alignment of an application executable.
