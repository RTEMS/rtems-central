\subsection{Chapter 33 RED-BLACK TREES}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

p622:

Red-black trees are used when a binary search tree is needed,
including dynamic priority thread queues and non-contiguous heap memory

\subsubsection{Background}

A tree is parameterized as either unique, meaning identical keys are rejected,
or not,
in which case duplicate keys are allowed.

No internal synchronization is offered within the red-black tree implementation,
thus users must ensure
at most one thread accesses a red-black tree instance at a time.

\subsubsection{Directives}
p625:

Source documentation for the Red-Black Tree API can be found
in the generated Doxygen output for \verb"cpukit/sapi".
