    description: |
      This set of attributes specifies functional requirements and
      corresponding validation test code.  The functional requirements of an
      action are specified.  An action performs a step in a finite state
      machine.  An action is implemented through a function or a macro.  The
      action is performed through a call of the function or an execution of the
      code of an macro expansion by an actor.  The actor is for example a task
      or an interrupt service routine.

      There shall be exactly one link with the
      ${interface-function-role:/spec-name} to the interface of the action.

      The action requirements are specified by

      * a list of pre-conditions, each with a set of states,

      * a list of post-conditions, each with a set of states,

      * the transition of pre-condition states to post-condition states through
        the action.

      Along with the requirements, the test code to generate a validation test
      is specified.  For an action requirement it is verified that all
      variations of pre-condition states have a set of post-condition states
      specified in the transition map.  All transitions are covered by the
      generated test code.
