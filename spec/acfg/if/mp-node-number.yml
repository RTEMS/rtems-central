notes: |
  In the RTEMS Multiprocessing Test Suite, the node number is derived from
  the Makefile variable ``NODE_NUMBER``. The same code is compiled with the
  ``NODE_NUMBER`` set to different values. The test programs behave
  differently based upon their node number.

  This configuration option is only evaluated if
  ${mp-appl:/name} is defined.
