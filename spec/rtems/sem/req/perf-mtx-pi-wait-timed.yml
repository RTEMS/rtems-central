  brief: |
    Obtain the unavailable mutex and wait forever.

      ctx->mutex_id,
      RTEMS_WAIT,

  brief: |
    Make the mutex unavailable.
  code: |
    Send( ctx, EVENT_OBTAIN );

test-teardown:
  brief: |
    Set the measured runtime.  Restore the worker priority.  Release the mutex.
    Discard samples interrupted by a clock tick.

    *delta = ctx->end - ctx->begin;
    SetPriority( ctx->worker_id, PRIO_HIGH );

  Let U and V be two tasks with the same home scheduler.  Let :math:`B`
  be a time point measured by U right before a call to
  ${../if/obtain:/name} which blocks on the mutex with a timeout.  Let
  :math:`E` be a time point measured by V right after the first context
  switch after :math:`B`.

  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while the semaphore is
  a priority inheritance mutex, while the measurement sample is :math:`E - B`,
  when exactly ${../val/perf:/params/sample-count} samples are collected, the
  ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
