  pattern during system initialization.

notes: |
  Zeroing memory can add significantly to the system initialization time. It is
  not necessary for RTEMS but is often assumed by support libraries.  In case
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_DIRTY_MEMORY` is also defined, then the memory is first
  dirtied and then zeroed.
