  This directive suspends the task specified by ${.:/params[0]/name} from
  further execution by placing it in the suspended state.  This state is
  additive to any other blocked state that the task may already be in.  The
  task will not execute again until another task issues the ${resume:/name}
  directive for this task and any blocked state has been removed.  The
  ${restart:/name} directive will also remove the suspended state.

  The requesting task can suspend itself for example by specifying
  ${self-define:/name} as ${.:/params[0]/name}.  In this case, the task will be
  suspended and a successful return code will be returned when the task is
  resumed.
