term: SMP locks
text: |
  The SMP locks ensure mutual exclusion on the lowest level and are a
  replacement for the sections of disabled interrupts.  Interrupts are
  usually disabled while holding an SMP lock.  They are implemented using
  atomic operations.  Currently a ticket lock is used in RTEMS.
