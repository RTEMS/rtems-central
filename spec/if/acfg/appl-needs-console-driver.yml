  The Console Driver is responsible for providing the ``/dev/console``
  device file.  This device is used to initialize the standard input, output,
  and error file descriptors.

  BSPs should be constructed in a manner that allows ``printk()`` to work
  properly without the need for the Console Driver to be configured.

  * ${appl-needs-simple-console-driver:/name}, and

  * ${appl-needs-simple-task-console-driver:/name}

  configuration options are mutually exclusive.
