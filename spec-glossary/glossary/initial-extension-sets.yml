term: initial extension sets
text: |
  The initial extension sets are a table of ${userextensions:/term}.  The table
  is defined by the application configuration for example through the
  ${/acfg/if/initial-extensions:/name} application configuration option.  The
  initial extension sets cannot be altered during runtime through directive
  calls.  See also ${dynamic-extension-sets:/term}.
