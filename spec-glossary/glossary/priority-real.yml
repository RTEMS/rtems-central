term: real priority
text: |
  Each ${task:/term} has exactly one real priority.  The real priority is
  always with respect to the ${scheduler-home:/term} of a task.  It is defined
  during task initialization.  It may be changed by directives such as
  ${/rtems/task/if/set-priority:/name} and
  ${/rtems/task/if/set-scheduler:/name}.  The real priority is the foundation
  of the ${priority-current:/term}.
