appl-config-option-description: |
  In case this configuration option is defined, then each memory area returned
  by C Program Heap allocator functions such as :c:func:`malloc` is dirtied
  with a ``0xCF`` byte pattern before it is handed over to the application.
appl-config-option-index: []
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_MALLOC_DIRTY
appl-config-option-notes: |
  The dirtying performed by this option is carried out for each successful
  memory allocation from the C Program Heap in contrast to
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_DIRTY_MEMORY` which dirties the memory only once during the
  system initialization.
