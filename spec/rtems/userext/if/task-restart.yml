notes: |
  The task restart extensions are invoked in
  ${/glossary/extension-forward-order:/term}.

  The task restart extensions are invoked in the context of the restarted
  thread right before the execution context is reloaded.  The thread stack
  reflects the previous execution context.

  Thread restart and delete requests issued by restart extensions lead to
  recursion.
