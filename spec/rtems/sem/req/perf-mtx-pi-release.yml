  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while the semaphore is
  a priority inheritance mutex, while the measurement sample is the runtime of
  exactly one successful call to ${../if/release:/name} which does not unblock
  a waiting task, when exactly ${../val/perf:/params/sample-count} samples are
  collected, the ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
