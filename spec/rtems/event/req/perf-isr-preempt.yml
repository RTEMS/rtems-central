  Let U be an interrupt service and V be a task which both execute on the
  same processor.  Let :math:`B` be a time point measured by U right before
  a call to ${../if/send:/name} which unblocks task V which preempts the
  executing task.  Let :math:`E` be a time point measured by V right after
  the first context switch after :math:`B`.

  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while task V waits
  for events, while the measurement sample is :math:`E - B`, when exactly
  ${../val/perf:/params/sample-count} samples are collected, the
  ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
