    Send two events.  Satisfy the event condition.

  Let U and V be two tasks with the same home scheduler.  Let :math:`B`
  be a time point measured by U right before a call to ${../if/send:/name}
  which does satisfy the event condition of the waiting task V which does
  preempt the caller.  Let :math:`E` be a time point measured by V right
  after the first context switch after :math:`B`.

  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while the task V
  waits for events, while the measurement sample is :math:`E - B`, when exactly
  ${../val/perf:/params/sample-count} samples are collected, the
  ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
