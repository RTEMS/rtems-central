appl-config-option-description: |
  The value of this configuration option defines the maximum number of
  processors an application intends to use.  The number of actually available
  processors depends on the hardware and may be less.  It is recommended to use
  the smallest value suitable for the application in order to save memory.
  Each processor needs an IDLE task stack and interrupt stack for example.
appl-config-option-index: []
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_PROCESSORS
appl-config-option-notes: |
  If there are more processors available than configured, the rest will be
  ignored.

  This configuration option is only evaluated in SMP configurations (e.g. RTEMS
  was built with the ``--enable-smp`` build configuration option).  In all
  other configurations it has no effect.
