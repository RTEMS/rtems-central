notes: |
  When the message queue is deleted, any messages in the queue are returned to
  the free message buffer pool.  Any information stored in those messages is
  lost.  The message buffers allocated for the message queue are reclaimed.

  The ${/glossary/qcb:/term} for the deleted message queue is reclaimed by
  RTEMS.

  When a global message queue is deleted, the message queue identifier must be
  transmitted to every node in the system for deletion from the local copy of
  the global object table.

  The message queue must reside on the local node, even if the message queue
  was created with the ${../../attr/if/global:/name} attribute.

  Proxies, used to represent remote tasks, are reclaimed when the message queue
  is deleted.
