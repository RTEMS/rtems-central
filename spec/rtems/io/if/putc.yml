  The directive outputs the character specified by ${.:/params[0]/name} to the
  kernel character output device using the polled character output
  implementation provided by ${bsp-output-char:/name}.  The directive performs
  a character translation from ``NL`` to ``CR`` followed by ``NR``.

  If the kernel character output device is concurrently accessed, then
  interleaved output may occur.
