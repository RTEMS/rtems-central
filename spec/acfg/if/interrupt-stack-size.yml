notes: |
  There is one interrupt stack available for each configured processor
  (${max-processors:/name}).  The interrupt stack areas are
  statically allocated in a special linker section (``.rtemsstack.interrupt``).
  The placement of this linker section is BSP-specific.

  Some BSPs use the interrupt stack as the initialization stack which is used
  to perform the sequential system initialization before the multithreading
  is started.

  The interrupt stacks are covered by the stack checker, see
  ${stack-checker-enabled:/name}.  However, using a too small interrupt stack
  size may still result in undefined behaviour.

  In releases before RTEMS 5.1 the default value was
  ${min-task-stack-size:/name} instead of
  ${/score/cpu/if/stack-minimum-size:/name}.
