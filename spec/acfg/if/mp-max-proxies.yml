notes: |
  Since a proxy is used to represent a remote task/thread which is blocking
  on this node. This configuration parameter reflects the maximum number of
  remote tasks/threads which can be blocked on objects on this node, see
  ${/doc/if/mp-proxies:/name}.

  This configuration option is only evaluated if
  ${mp-appl:/name} is defined.
