description: |
  This directive creates a barrier which resides on the local node.  The
  barrier has the user-defined object name specified in ${.:/params[0]/name}
  and the initial count specified in ${.:/params[1]/name}.  The assigned object
  identifier is returned in ${.:/params[3]/name}.  This identifier is used to
  access the barrier with other barrier related directives.

  The **attribute set** specified in ${.:/params[1]/name} is built through a
  *bitwise or* of the attribute constants described below.  Not all
  combinations of attributes are allowed.  Some attributes are mutually
  exclusive.  If mutually exclusive attributes are combined, the behaviour is
  undefined.  Attributes not mentioned below are not evaluated by this
  directive and have no effect.  Default attributes can be selected by using
  the ${../../attr/if/default:/name} constant.

  The **barrier class** is selected by the mutually exclusive
  ${../../attr/if/barrier-manual-release:/name} and
  ${../../attr/if/barrier-automatic-release:/name} attributes.

  * The **manual release class** is the default and can be emphasized through
    use of the ${../../attr/if/barrier-manual-release:/name} attribute.  For
    this class, there is no limit on the number of tasks that will block at the
    barrier. Only when the ${release:/name} directive is invoked, are the tasks
    waiting at the barrier unblocked.

  * The **automatic release class** is selected by the
    ${../../attr/if/barrier-automatic-release:/name} attribute.  For this
    class, tasks calling the ${wait:/name} directive will block until there are
    ${.:/params[2]/name} minus one tasks waiting at the barrier.  When the
    ${.:/params[2]/name} task invokes the ${wait:/name} directive, the previous
    ${.:/params[2]/name} - 1 tasks are automatically released and the caller
    returns.

  For control and maintenance of the barrier, RTEMS allocates a
  ${/glossary/bcb:/term} from the local BCB free pool and initializes it.
