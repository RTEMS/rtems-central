appl-config-option-data-type: |
  Boolean feature macro.
appl-config-option-default-value: |
  This is not defined by default, which specifies that the C Program Heap and
  the RTEMS Workspace will be separate.
appl-config-option-description: |
  When defined, the C Program Heap and the RTEMS Workspace will be one pool
  of memory.

  When not defined, there will be separate memory pools for the RTEMS
  Workspace and C Program Heap.
appl-config-option-index:
- unified work areas
- separate work areas
- RTEMS Workspace
- C Program Heap
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_UNIFIED_WORK_AREAS
appl-config-option-notes: |
  Having separate pools does have some advantages in the event a task blows a
  stack or writes outside its memory area. However, in low memory systems the
  overhead of the two pools plus the potential for unused memory in either
  pool is very undesirable.

  In high memory environments, this is desirable when you want to use the
  RTEMS "unlimited" objects option.  You will be able to create objects until
  you run out of all available memory rather then just until you run out of
  RTEMS Workspace.
