notes: |
  The scheduler is set determined by the highest numbered processor in the
  affinity set specified by ${.:/params[2]/name}.

  This operation is only reliable in case the interrupt server was suspended
  via ${server-suspend:/name}.

    is the interrupt server index.  The constant ${server-default:/name} may be
    used to specify the default interrupt server.

    is the pointer to a ${/c/if/cpu_set_t:/name} object.  The processor set
    defines the new processor affinity set of the interrupt server.  A set bit
    in the processor set means that the corresponding processor shall be in the
    processor affinity set of the task, otherwise the bit shall be cleared.
