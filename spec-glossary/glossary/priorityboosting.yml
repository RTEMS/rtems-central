text: |
  A simple approach to extend the priority inheritance protocol for
  clustered scheduling is priority boosting.  In case a mutex is owned by a
  task of another cluster, then the priority of the owner task is raised to
  an artificially high priority.  This approach is not used in RTEMS, see also
  ${omip:/term}.
