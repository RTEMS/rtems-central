  This directive obtains a partition identifier associated with the partition
  name specified in ${.:/params[0]/name}.

  The node to search is specified in ${.:/params[1]/name}.  It shall be

  * a valid node number,

  * the constant ${../../object/if/search-all-nodes:/name} to search in all nodes,

  * the constant ${../../object/if/search-local-node:/name} to search in the local
    node only, or

  * the constant ${../../object/if/search-other-nodes:/name} to search in all nodes
    except the local node.

notes: |
  If the partition name is not unique, then the partition identifier will match
  the first partition with that name in the search order.  However, this
  partition identifier is not guaranteed to correspond to the desired
  partition.

  The objects are searched from lowest to the highest index.  If
  ${.:/params[1]/name} is ${../../object/if/search-all-nodes:/name}, all nodes
  are searched with the local node being searched first.  All other nodes are
  searched from lowest to the highest node number.

  If node is a valid node number which does not represent the local node, then
  only the partitions exported by the designated node are searched.

  This directive does not generate activity on remote nodes.  It accesses only
  the local copy of the global object table.

  The partition identifier is used with other partition related directives to
  access the partition.
