  Items of this type shall have the following links:

  * There shall be exactly one link to a ${qdp-directory-state:/spec-name} item
    with the ${qdp-input-role:/spec-name} and the name ``variant``.  This link
    defines the package variant.

  * There shall be exactly one link to a ${qdp-directory-state:/spec-name} item
    with the ${qdp-input-role:/spec-name} and the name ``source``.  This link
    defines the source repository.

  * There shall be exactly one link to a ${qdp-directory-state:/spec-name} item

      This set of attributes specifies a subset of repository files.  It may be
      used to create a subset of the RTEMS sources which contains only the
      pre-qualified feature set.  These sources can be used to verify the build
      of the pre-qualified libraries.  It can be also used to build the SDD
      with Doxygen restricted to the pre-qualified feature set.
