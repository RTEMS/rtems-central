  This section describes configuration options related to selecting a
  scheduling algorithm for an application.  A scheduler configuration is optional
  and only necessary in very specific circumstances.  A normal application
  configuration does not need any of the configuration options described in this
  section.

  By default, the :ref:`Deterministic Priority Scheduler <SchedulerPriority>`
  algorithm is used in uniprocessor configurations.  In case SMP is enabled and
  the configured maximum processors
  (:ref:`CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_PROCESSORS <CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_PROCESSORS>`) is greater
  than one, then the :ref:`Earliest Deadline First (EDF) SMP Scheduler
  <SchedulerSMPEDF>` is selected as the default scheduler algorithm.

  For the :ref:`schedulers built into
  RTEMS <SchedulingConcepts>`, the configuration is straightforward.  All that is
  required is to define the configuration option which specifies which scheduler
  you want for in your application.

  The pluggable scheduler interface also enables the user to provide their own
  scheduling algorithm.  If you choose to do this, you must define multiple
  configuration option.
