notes: |
  By default, the calculation for the required memory in the RTEMS Workspace
  for tasks assumes that all Classic API Tasks are created by
  ${../rtems/tasks/create:/name}.  This configuration option can be used to
  reduce the required memory for the system-provided task storage areas since
  tasks constructed by ${../rtems/tasks/construct:/name} use a user-provided
  task storage area.
