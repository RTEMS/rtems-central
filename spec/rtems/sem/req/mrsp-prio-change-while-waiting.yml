  While a thread has a higher ${/glossary/priority-current:/term} than the
  ceiling priority of a MrsP semaphore, while the semaphore has an owner
  thread, if the thread tries to obtain the semaphore, then an error status is
  returned to notify about a priority ceiling violation.  This error condition
  is not checked if the ${/glossary/priority-current:/term} is raised to a
  higher priority than the ceiling priority while the thread is enqueued on the
  thread queue of the semaphore.  It would complicate the implementation
  considerable to check this error condition and restore the thread state so
  that an error status can be returned.  The error check before the thread is
  enqueued helps to detect application design issues.  For the implementation
  it does not matter if the ${/glossary/priority-current:/term} is higher than
  a ceiling priority.

  While a thread is waiting to obtain a MrsP semaphore, while its
  ${/glossary/priority-current:/term} changed so that it is higher than the
  ceiling priority of the semaphore, the thread is allowed to become the new
  owner of the semaphore.
