  After initialization, the list of actions of the interrupt server entry is

  Interrupt server entries may be moved to another interrupt vector with
  ${server-entry-move:/name}.  Server entries may be submitted to get serviced
  by the interrupt server with ${server-entry-submit:/name}.  Server entries
  may be destroyed by ${server-entry-destroy:/name}.
