description: |
  The concept of scheduling in real-time systems dictates the ability to
  provide an immediate response to specific external events, particularly the
  necessity of scheduling tasks to run within a specified time limit after the
  occurrence of an event. For example, software embedded in life-support
  systems used to monitor hospital patients must take instant action if a
  change in the patient’s status is detected.

  The component of RTEMS responsible for providing this capability is
  appropriately called the scheduler. The scheduler’s sole purpose is to
  allocate the all important resource of processor time to the various tasks
  competing for attention.
