term: clock tick
text: |
  The clock tick is a coarse time measure provided by RTEMS.  The
  ${clock-driver:/term} emits clock ticks at rate specified by the
  ${/acfg/if/microseconds-per-tick:/name} application configuration option.  In
  contrast to ${clock-realtime:/term} and ${clock-monotonic:/term}, the clock
  tick rate is not affected by incremental adjustments.
