  First, if the ``__USER_LABEL_PREFIX__`` is defined when the macro is
  defined, it must also be defined at all places where the macro is used.
  Second, value of the ``__USER_LABEL_PREFIX__`` is not stored in the
  macro but can be different each time the macro is called.

  While the symbol ``__USER_LABEL_PREFIX__`` *is* defined
  during pre-processing of the ``basedefs.h`` file,
  the ${../if/symbol-name:/name} macro shall
  use the value which the ``__USER_LABEL_PREFIX__`` has at the place
  the macro call is processed.
