  The Clock Driver is responsible for providing a regular interrupt
  which invokes a clock tick directive.

  The application shall define exactly one of the following configuration options

  * ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CLOCK_DRIVER``,

  * ${appl-does-not-need-clock-driver:/name}, or

  * ${appl-needs-timer-driver:/name},

  otherwise a compile time error in the configuration file will occur.
