  The ${../if/have-member-same-type:/name} does only work in C.
  Type qualifiers do not matter (``const int`` is
  compatible to ``int``); arrays with undefined length are compatible
  with arrays of defined length (``int[]`` is compatible
  to ``int[5]``); enums are always incompatible; the number of pointer
  indirection matters (``**int`` is not compatible with ``*int``).

  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and argument ${../if/have-member-same-type:/params[0]/name} is a union or
  structure,
  and ${../if/have-member-same-type:/params[1]/name} is a member of
  ${../if/have-member-same-type:/params[0]/name},
  and argument ${../if/have-member-same-type:/params[2]/name} is a union or
  structure,
  and ${../if/have-member-same-type:/params[3]/name} is a member of
  ${../if/have-member-same-type:/params[2]/name},
  the ${../if/have-member-same-type:/name} macro shall
  evaluate to the integer values 1 or 0 depending on whether
  the types of the members ${../if/have-member-same-type:/params[1]/name}
  and ${../if/have-member-same-type:/params[3]/name} are compatible in
  the sense of C.
