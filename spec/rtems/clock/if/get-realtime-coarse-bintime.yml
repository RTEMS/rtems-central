notes: |
  The directive does not access a device to get the time.  It uses a recent
  snapshot provided by the ${/glossary/clock-driver:/term}.  Alternatively, the
  ${get-realtime-bintime:/name} directive may be used to get the time with
  higher precision and higher runtime overhead.

  See ${get-realtime-coarse:/name} and ${get-realtime-coarse-timeval:/name} to
  get the time in alternative formats.

    is the pointer to a ${/c/if/bintime:/name} object.  The time elapsed since
    the ${/glossary/unix-epoch:/term} measured using the
    ${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term} at some time point close to the directive
    call will be stored in this object.  Calling the directive with a pointer
    equal to ${/c/if/null:/name} is undefined behaviour.
