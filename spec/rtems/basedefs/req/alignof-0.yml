  Note that if not ``__STDC_VERSION__ >= 201112L`` and neither
  ``__cplusplus >= 201103L``, the result of this call may return a value
  which is not appropriate for alignment.

  When the code is compiled with a C compiler and
  the ``__STDC_VERSION__`` symbol is defined with version ``201112L`` or
  higher or
  the code is compiled with a C++ compiler
  and the ``__cplusplus`` symbol is defined with version ``201103L`` or higher,
  and the argument ${../if/alignof:/params[0]/name} is a type,
  and the argument ${../if/alignof:/params[0]/name} is not a function type,
  and the argument ${../if/alignof:/params[0]/name} is a complete type,
  the macro ${../if/alignof:/name} shall result in
  the alignment requirement in bytes required for any instance of the type.
