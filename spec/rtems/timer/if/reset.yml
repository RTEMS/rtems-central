  This directive resets the timer specified by ${.:/params[0]/name}.  This
  timer must have been previously initiated with either the ${fire-after:/name}
  or ${server-fire-after:/name} directive.  If active the timer is canceled,
  after which the timer is reinitiated using the same interval and timer
  service routine which the original ${fire-after:/name} or
  ${server-fire-after:/name} directive used.

notes: |
  If the timer has not been used or the last usage of this timer was by a
  ${fire-when:/name} or ${server-fire-when:/name} directive, then the
  ${../../status/if/not-defined:/name} error is returned.

  Restarting a cancelled after timer results in the timer being reinitiated
  with its previous timer service routine and interval.
