  The ``syscall_irqdis_fp`` trap handler always jumps back to a floating-point

  The ``syscall_lazy_fp_switch`` trap handler always jumps back to a
  floating-point instruction or terminates the system with a jump to
  ``_Internal_error()``, thus no workaround is necessary.  The
  ``_Internal_error()`` function starts with a ``save`` instruction.  Also this
  function terminates the system, so that the ``rett`` instruction should never
  be in the instruction cache since the code path is only executed once.
