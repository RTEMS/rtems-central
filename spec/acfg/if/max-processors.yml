  The value of this configuration option defines the maximum number of
  processors an application intends to use.  The number of actually available
  processors depends on the hardware and may be less.  It is recommended to use
  the smallest value suitable for the application in order to save memory.
  Each processor needs an IDLE task stack and interrupt stack for example.

  If there are more processors available than configured, the rest will be

  This configuration option is only evaluated in SMP configurations of RTEMS
  (e.g. RTEMS was built with the SMP build configuration option enabled).
  In all other configurations it has no effect.
