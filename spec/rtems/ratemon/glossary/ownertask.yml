  The owner ${/glossary/task:/term} of a period is the ${/glossary/task:/term}
  which created it by successfully invoking ${../if/create:/name}.  The
  ${/glossary/task:/term} looses the ownership when the period is deleted
  by a call to ${../if/delete:/name}.  The ${../if/group:/name} permits
  only the ${/glossary/task:/term} owning a period to invoke
  ${../if/period:/name}.
