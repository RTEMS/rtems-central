  This directive allows a buffer to be obtained from the partition specified in
  the ``${.:/params[0]/name}`` parameter.  The address of the allocated buffer is
  returned through the ``${.:/params[1]/name}`` parameter.

notes: |
  This directive will not cause the running task to be preempted.

  The buffer start alignment is determined by the memory area and buffer size
  used to create the partition.

  A task cannot wait on a buffer to become available.

  Getting a buffer from a global partition which does not reside on the local
  node will generate a request telling the remote node to allocate a buffer
  from the partition.
