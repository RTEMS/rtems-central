      presented to the item by the build item context.  For an
      :ref:`SpecTypeBuildGroupItemType` item the includes are visible to all
      items referenced by the group item.  For :ref:`SpecTypeBuildBSPItemType`,
      :ref:`SpecTypeBuildObjectsItemType`, :ref:`SpecTypeBuildLibraryItemType`,
      :ref:`SpecTypeBuildStartFileItemType`, and
      :ref:`SpecTypeBuildTestProgramItemType` items the includes are only
      visible to the sources specified by the item itself and they do not
      propagate to referenced items.
