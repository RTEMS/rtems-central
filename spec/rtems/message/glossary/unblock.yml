  Given a ${/glossary/task:/term} which has invoked an
  ${/glossary/rtems:/term} directive and that directive stopped the
  execution of this ${/glossary/task:/term}.  *Unblock* means that this
  ${/glossary/task:/term} stops waiting, the directive returns and the
  execution of this ${/glossary/task:/term} continues.

  For example a ${/glossary/task:/term}
  which has invoked directive ${../if/receive:/name} and which was
  waiting to receive a message from the ${/glossary/messagequeue:/term}
  stops waiting because it received a message,
  directive ${../if/receive:/name} returns and the execution of this
  ${/glossary/task:/term} continues.
