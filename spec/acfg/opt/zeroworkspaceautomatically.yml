appl-config-option-description: |
  In case this configuration option is defined, then the memory areas used for
  the RTEMS Workspace and the C Program Heap are zeroed with a ``0x00`` byte
  pattern during system initialization.
appl-config-option-index:
- clear C Program Heap
- clear RTEMS Workspace
- zero C Program Heap
- zero RTEMS Workspace
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_ZERO_WORKSPACE_AUTOMATICALLY
appl-config-option-notes: |
  Zeroing memory can add significantly to the system initialization time. It is
  not necessary for RTEMS but is often assumed by support libraries.  In case
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_DIRTY_MEMORY` is also defined, then the memory is first
  dirtied and then zeroed.
