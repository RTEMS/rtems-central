  Let :math:`B` be a time point measured by a task right before a call to
  ${../if/restart:/name} which restarts the caller.  Let :math:`E` be a time
  point measured by V right after the first context switch after :math:`B`.

  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while the measurement
  sample is :math:`E - B`, the ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
