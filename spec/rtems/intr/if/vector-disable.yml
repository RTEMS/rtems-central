  The directive disables the interrupt vector specified by

notes: |
  The ${get-attributes:/name} directive may be used to check if an interrupt
  vector can be disabled.  Interrupt vectors may be enabled by
  ${vector-enable:/name}.  There may be targets on which some interrupt vectors
  cannot be disabled, for example a hardware watchdog interrupt or software
  generated interrupts.
