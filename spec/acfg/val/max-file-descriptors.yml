  Setting ${../if/max-file-descriptors:/name} to zero is mandatory for
  applications using only the pre-qualified feature set.  The reason is to get
  linker errors in case such applications are linked if they depend on file
  descriptors.  Thus no validation test case can be used.  Inspection of the
  referenced ${/glossary/sourcecode:/term} file showed that no file descriptor
  table is statically allocated, if ${../if/max-file-descriptors:/name} is
  defined to zero, otherwise a table with an entry count specified by the
  option is statically allocated.  For a not pre-qualified only build of RTEMS,
  a file descriptor table with zero entries is provided by an RTEMS library.
  This shows that the ${../req/max-file-descriptors:/spec} requirement is implemented
  as specified.
