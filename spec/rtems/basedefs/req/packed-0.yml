  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and the ${../if/packed:/name} macro is used as last part of a
  structure member declaration,
  and the ``aligned`` attribute or ${../if/aligned:/name} macro
  is not used on this structure member,
  the ${../if/packed:/name} macro shall cause the structure member
  to be aligned at one bit for a bit-field member and one byte otherwise.
