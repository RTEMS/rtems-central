  This directive will not cause the running task to be preempted.

  Returning a buffer to a global partition which does not reside on the local
  node will generate a request telling the remote node to return the buffer to
  the partition.

  Returning a buffer multiple times is an error.  It will corrupt the internal
  state of the partition.
