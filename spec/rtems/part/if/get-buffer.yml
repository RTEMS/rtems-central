  This directive allows a buffer to be obtained from the partition specified by
  ${.:/params[0]/name}.  The address of the allocated buffer is returned
  through the ${.:/params[1]/name} parameter.

notes: |
  The buffer start alignment is determined by the memory area and buffer size
  used to create the partition.

  A task cannot wait on a buffer to become available.

  Getting a buffer from a global partition which does not reside on the local
  node will generate a request telling the remote node to allocate a buffer
  from the partition.
