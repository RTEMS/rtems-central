notes: |
  The partition cannot be deleted if any of its buffers are still allocated.

  The ${/glossary/ptcb:/term} for the deleted partition is reclaimed by RTEMS.

  When a global partition is deleted, the partition identifier must be
  transmitted to every node in the system for deletion from the local copy of
  the global object table.

  The partition must reside on the local node, even if the partition was
  created with the ${../../attr/if/global:/name} attribute.
