  An interrupt server requests consists of an interrupt server entry and
  exactly one interrupt server action.  The interrupt vector of the request may
  be changed with ${server-request-set-vector:/name}.  Interrupt server
  requests may be submitted to get serviced by the interrupt server with
  ${server-request-submit:/name}.  Requests may be destroyed by
  ${server-request-destroy:/name}.
