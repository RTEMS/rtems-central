appl-config-option-type: integer
appl-config-option-default-value: |
  The default value is :ref:`BSP_INTERRUPT_STACK_SIZE` in case it is defined,
  otherwise the default value is ``CPU_STACK_MINIMUM_SIZE``.
appl-config-option-description: |
  The value of this configuration option defines the size of an interrupt stack
  in bytes.
appl-config-option-index:
- interrupt stack size
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_INTERRUPT_STACK_SIZE
appl-config-option-notes: |
  The interrupt stack size must be aligned according to
  ``CPU_INTERRUPT_STACK_ALIGNMENT``.

  There is one interrupt stack available for each configured processor
  (:ref:`CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_PROCESSORS`).  The interrupt stack areas are
  statically allocated in a special linker section (``.rtemsstack.interrupt``).
  The placement of this linker section is BSP-specific.

  Some BSPs use the interrupt stack as the initialization stack which is used
  to perform the sequential system initialization before the multithreading
  is started.

  The interrupt stacks are covered by the :ref:`stack checker
  <CONFIGURE_STACK_CHECKER_ENABLED>`.  However, using a too small interrupt
  stack size may still result in undefined behaviour.

  In releases before RTEMS 5.1 the default value was
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_MINIMUM_TASK_STACK_SIZE` instead of ``CPU_STACK_MINIMUM_SIZE``.
appl-config-option-constraint:
  custom:
  - |
    It must be greater than or equal to a BSP-specific and application-specific
    minimum value.
  - |
    It must be small enough so that the interrupt stack area calculation
    carried out by ``<rtems/confdefs.h>`` does not overflow an integer of type
    ``size_t``.
