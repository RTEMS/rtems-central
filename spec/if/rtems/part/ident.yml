  This directive obtains the partition identifier associated with the partition
  name specified in ``${.:/params[0]/name}``.

  The node to search is specified in ``${.:/params[1]/name}``.  It shall be

  * a valid node number,

  * the constant ${../object/search-all-nodes:/name} to search in all nodes,

  * the constant ${../object/search-local-node:/name} to search in the local
    node only, or

  * the constant ${../object/search-other-nodes:/name} to search in all nodes
    except the local node.

notes: |
  If the partition name is not unique, then the partition identifier will match
  the first partition with that name in the search order.  However, this
  partition identifier is not guaranteed to correspond to the desired
  partition.  The partition identifier is used with other partition related
  directives to access the partition.

  If node is ${../object/search-all-nodes:/name}, all nodes are searched with
  the local node being searched first.  All other nodes are searched with the
  lowest numbered node searched first.

  If node is a valid node number which does not represent the local node, then
  only the partitions exported by the designated node are searched.

  This directive does not generate activity on remote nodes.  It accesses only
  the local copy of the global object table.
