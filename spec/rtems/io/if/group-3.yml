  The directives may be used to print debug and test information.  The kernel
  character input/output support should work even if no Console Driver is
  configured, see ${/acfg/if/appl-needs-console-driver:/name}.  The kernel
  character input and output device is provided by the ${/glossary/bsp:/term}.
  Applications may change the device.
