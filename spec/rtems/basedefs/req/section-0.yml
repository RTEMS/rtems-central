  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and the ${../if/section:/name} macro is attached to a
  function declaration or definition or a global variable definition,
  and the argument ${../if/section:/params[0]/name} after applying
  all possible C pre-processor substitutions to its value is a
  C sting containing valid linker section name,
  and the file format used supports arbitary sections,
  the macro shall cause the compiler to store the function or
  variable in a section named like the result of the pre-processor
  substitutions on its argument ${../if/section:/params[0]/name}.
