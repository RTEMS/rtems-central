term: task priority
text: |
  A task ${priority:/term} of a ${task:/term} determines its importance
  relative to other tasks.
  
  The scheduler use task priorities to determine which ${readytask:/term} gets
  a processor allocated, see ${scheduledtask:/term}.  The
  ${priority-eligible:/plural} of a task define the position of the task in a
  ${waitqueue:/term} which uses the priority discipline.  Each task has at
  least the ${priority-real:/term}.

  Task priorities are used in ${waitqueue:/plural} which use the priority
  discipline to determine the dequeueing order of tasks.
