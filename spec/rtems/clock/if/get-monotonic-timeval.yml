notes: |
  The directive accesses a device provided by the
  ${/glossary/clock-driver:/term} to get the time in the highest resolution
  available to the system.  Alternatively, the
  ${get-monotonic-coarse-timeval:/name} directive may be used to get the time
  in a lower resolution and with less runtime overhead.

  See ${get-monotonic:/name}, ${get-monotonic-bintime:/name}, and
  ${get-monotonic-sbintime:/name} to get the time in alternative formats.

    is the pointer to a ${/c/if/timeval:/name} object.  The time elapsed since
    some fixed time point in the past measured using the
    ${/glossary/clock-monotonic:/term} at some time point during the directive
    call will be stored in this object.  Calling the directive with a pointer
    equal to ${/c/if/null:/name} is undefined behaviour.
