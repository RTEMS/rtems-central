  The value of this configuration option defines the maximum number of POSIX
  API Threads that can be concurrently active.

appl-config-option-notes: |
  This object class can be configured in unlimited allocation mode, see
  :ref:`ConfigUnlimitedObjects`.

  This calculations for the required memory in the RTEMS Workspace for
  threads assume that each thread has a minimum stack size and has floating
  point support enabled.  The configuration option
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_EXTRA_TASK_STACKS` is used to specify thread stack
  requirements **above** the minimum size required.  See :ref:`Reserve
  Task/Thread Stack Memory Above Minimum` for more information about
  ``CONFIGURE_EXTRA_TASK_STACKS``.

  The maximum number of Classic API Tasks is specified by
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_TASKS`.

  All POSIX threads have floating point enabled.

    It must be less than or equal to a BSP-specific value which depends on the
    memory size of the platform available to the application.
  - |
    It must be small enough so that the task stack space calculation carried
    out by ``<rtems/confdefs.h>`` does not overflow an integer of type
    ``uintptr_t``.
