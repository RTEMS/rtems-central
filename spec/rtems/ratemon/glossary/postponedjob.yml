  A postponed job is a ${../glossary/job:/term} which should already have been
  started but which has not yet been started because an earlier
  ${../glossary/job:/term} is still executed.  Postponed jobs exist in
  ${../glossary/active:/term} and ${../glossary/expired:/term}
  ${../glossary/state:/term}.

  Note that the ${../if/cancel:/name}
  directive does not change the number of postponed jobs,
  ${../glossary/elapsed:/term} or ${../glossary/consumed:/term}
  ${../glossary/time:/term}.  Moreover, the ${../if/create:/name}
  directive does not set these values 0.

  The period has a counter for the number of currently postponed jobs (with a
  maximum of 0xffffffff).  The number of postponed jobs is increased whenever
  the execution of the current ${../glossary/job:/term} exceeds the time
  ${../glossary/interval:/term} length allotted for the current job (with the
  ${../glossary/interval:/term} starting over again).  This assumes and in
  effect works only correct when all future jobs have the same
  ${../glossary/interval:/term} length as the current one.

  If one or more postponed jobs are present when ${../if/period:/name} is
  called, ${../if/period:/name} returns immediately without waiting for the
  end of an ${../glossary/interval:/term} in an attempt to reduce the number
  of postponed jobs.
