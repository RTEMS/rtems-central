  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and the ${../if/alloc-align:/name} macro is used as last part of a
  function declaration,
  and ${../if/alloc-align:/params[0]/name} is a constant number
  referring to an argument of that function
  (counting of arguments starts at 1 from the left),
  and the argument with that number is an integral value of a power of two,
  and the declared function
  returns a pointer to memory which starts at an integral *multiple*
  of the value provided by the function argument number
  ${../if/alloc-align:/params[0]/name},
  the macro shall cause the compiler to use the information of the alignment
  of the returned memory in its pointer analysis.
