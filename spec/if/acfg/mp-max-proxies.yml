notes: |
  Since a proxy is used to represent a remote task/thread which is blocking
  on this node. This configuration parameter reflects the maximum number of
  remote tasks/threads which can be blocked on objects on this node, see
  :ref:`MPCIProxies`.

  This configuration option is only evaluated if
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_MP_APPLICATION` is defined.
