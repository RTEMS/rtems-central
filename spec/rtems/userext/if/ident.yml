notes: |
  If the extension set name is not unique, then the extension set identifier
  will match the first extension set with that name in the search order.
  However, this extension set identifier is not guaranteed to correspond to the
  desired extension set.

  The objects are searched from lowest to the highest index.  Only the local
  node is searched.

  The extension set identifier is used with other extension related directives
  to access the extension set.
