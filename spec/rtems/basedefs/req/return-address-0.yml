non-functional-type: interface
rationale: |
  From the GNU C compiler documentation:

  * When inlining the expected behavior is that the function returns
    the address of the function that is returned to.
  * When the top of the stack has been reached, this function returns
    an unspecified value.
  * Additional post-processing of the returned value may be needed, see
    ``__builtin_extract_return_addr``.
  * The stored representation of the return address in memory may be
    different from the address returned by ``__builtin_return_address``.

  Under these circumstances it is at least difficult to specify
  what the actual result of this macro is.

  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  the ${../if/return-address:/name} macro shall evaluate to the
  code ``__builtin_return_address( 0 )``.
