  This section describes configuration options related to filesytems.
  By default, the In-Memory Filesystem (IMFS) is used as the base filesystem (also
  known as root filesystem).  In order to save some memory for your application,
  you can disable the filesystem support with the
  ${appl-disable-filesystem:/name} configuration option.
  Alternatively, you can strip down the features of the base filesystem with the
  ${use-miniimfs-as-base-filesystem:/name} and
  ${use-devfs-as-base-filesystem:/name} configuration options.  These
  three configuration options are mutually exclusive.  They are intended for an
  advanced application configuration.

  Features of the IMFS can be disabled and enabled with the following
  configuration options:

  * ${imfs-disable-chmod:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-chown:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-link:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-mknod:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-mknod-file:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-mount:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-readdir:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-readlink:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-rename:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-rmnod:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-symlink:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-unmount:/name}

  * ${imfs-disable-utime:/name}

  * ${imfs-enable-mkfifo:/name}
