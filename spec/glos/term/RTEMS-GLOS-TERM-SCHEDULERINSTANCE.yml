  A scheduler instance is a scheduling algorithm with a corresponding
  context to store its internal state.  Each processor in the system is
  owned by at most one scheduler instance.  The processor to scheduler
  instance assignment is determined at application configuration time.  See
  :ref:`Configuring a System`.
