      This set of attributes specifies an Ada test program executable to build.
      Test programs may use additional objects provided by
      ${build-objects:/spec-name} items.  Test programs have an implicit
      ``enabled-by`` attribute value which is controlled by the option action
      :ref:`set-test-state <SpecTypeBuildOptionItemType>`.  If the test state
      is set to ``exclude``, then the test program is not built.
