      This set of attributes specifies a register block.  A register block may
      be used to specify the interface of devices which use a linear address
      space.  Register blocks consist of register block members specified by
      the ``definition`` attribute.  Register block members are either
      instances of registers specified by the ``registers`` attribute or
      instances of other register blocks specified by links with the
      ${interface-register-block-include-role:/spec-name}.  Registers consists
      of bit fields (see ${interface-register-bits:/spec-name}.  The register
      block members are placed into the address space of the device relative to
      the base address of the register block.  Register member offests and the
      register block size are specified in units of the address space granule.
      The address space granule is usually 8-bits also known as one byte.
