  Let U and V be two tasks with the same home scheduler.  Let :math:`B`
  be a time point measured by U right before a call to
  ${../if/restart:/name} which starts task V which preempts the caller.
  Let :math:`E` be a time point measured by V right after the first context
  switch after :math:`B`.

  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while the measurement
  sample is :math:`E - B`, the ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
