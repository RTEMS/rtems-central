          The transition map may be customized to support configuration
          variants through this attribute.  The default transitions
          (``enabled-by: true``) shall be specified before the customized
          variants in the list.

      This set of attributes defines the transition from multiple sets of
      states of pre-conditions to a set of states of post-conditions through an
      action in an action requirement.  The ability to specify multiple sets of
      states of pre-conditions which result in a common set of post-conditions
      may allow a more compact specification of the transition map.  For
      example, let us suppose you want to specify the action of a function with
      a pointer parameter.  The function performs an early check that the
      pointer is NULL and in this case returns an error code.  The pointer
      condition dominates the action outcome if the pointer is NULL.  Other
      pre-condition states can be simply set to ``all`` for this transition.
