  This directive creates a timer which resides on the local node.  The timer
  has the user-defined object name specified in ${.:/params[0]/name}.  The
  assigned object identifier is returned in ${.:/params[1]/name}.  This
  identifier is used to access the timer with other timer related directives.

notes: |
  The processor used to maintain the timer is the processor of the calling task
  at some point during the timer creation.

  For control and maintenance of the timer, RTEMS allocates a
  ${/glossary/tmcb:/term} from the local TMCB free pool and initializes it.
