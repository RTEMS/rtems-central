  The effect of the ${../if/packed:/name} macro is not propagated into any

  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and the ${../if/packed:/name} macro is attached to a
  struct, union, or C++ class type definition,
  and the ``aligned`` attribute or ${../if/aligned:/name} macro
  is not used on the struct, union, or C++ class type definition or
  any member thereof,
  the ${../if/packed:/name} macro shall cause all structure, union, or class
  members to be aligned at one bit for a bit-field member and
  one byte otherwise.
