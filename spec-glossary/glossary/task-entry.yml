  The task entry is invoked to execute the task's job.  Before the task entry
  is invoked, the thread begin ${userextensions:/term} run in the context of
  the task.  After the return of the task entry, the thread exitted user
  extensions run in the context of the task.  The first user initialization
  task performs the ${global-construction:/term} after running the thread begin
  extensions and before the task entry is invoked.  See also
  ${/rtems/task/if/start:/name}.
