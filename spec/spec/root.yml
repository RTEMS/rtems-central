          It shall be the item type.  The selection of types and the level of
          detail depends on a particular standard and product model.  We need
          enough flexibility to be in line with ECSS-E-ST-10-06 and possible
          future applications of other standards.  The item type may be refined
          further with additional type-specific subtypes.

      The technical specification of RTEMS will contain for example
      requirements, specializations of requirements, interface specifications,
      test suites, test cases, and requirement validations.  These things will
      be called *specification items* or just *items* if it is clear from the
      context.

      The specification items are stored in files in ${/glossary/yaml:/term}
      format with a defined set of key-value pairs called attributes.  Each
      attribute key name shall be a :ref:`SpecTypeName`.  In particular, key
      names which begin with an underscore (``_``) are reserved for internal
      use in tools.

      This is the root specification item type.
