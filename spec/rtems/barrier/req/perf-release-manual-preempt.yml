  Let U and V be two tasks with the same home scheduler.  Let :math:`B`
  be a time point measured by U right before a call to
  ${../if/release:/name} which preempts the caller.  Let :math:`E` be a time
  point measured by V right after a call to ${../if/wait:/name} returns
  successfully due to the ${../if/release:/name} call associated with
  :math:`B`.

  While the execution environment is ${.:/environment}, while the barrier is a
  manual release barrier, while the measurement sample is :math:`E - B`, when
  exactly ${../val/perf:/params/sample-count} samples are collected, the
  ${.:/limit-kind} shall be ${.:/limit-condition}.
