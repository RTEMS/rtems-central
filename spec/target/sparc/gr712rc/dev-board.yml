  The GR712RC development board comprises a custom designed PCB in a Double
  Eurocard format (233.5 mm x 160 mm) making the board suitable for stand-alone
  bench top development, or suitable for mounting in a housing. The principle
  interfaces and functions are accessible on the front and back edges of the
  the board.

  The GR712RC device incorporates an internal programmable switch matrix which
  means that the same input/output pin can be used for multiple functions. This
  board therefore has a large number of configuration features in order to be
  able to exercise and configure the functions of the device.

  Features:

  * GR712RC dual-core 32-bit fault tolerant LEON3-FT SPARC V8 processor

  * On-board memory:

    * SDRAM SODIMM (supports up 512 Mbyte devices. Delivered with 256 Mbyte
      module -  128 Mbyte 32-bit wide data & 64 Mbyte BCH 8-bit wide or
      Reed-Solomon 16-bit wide checksum)

    * SRAM (1 bank x 2 Mword x 40 bit, optional second bank not fitted as
      standard)

    * FLASH PROM (8 Mword x 8 bit)

    * Additional memory via memory expansion connector

  * Power, reset, clock and auxiliary circuits

  * Interfaces at front edge of board:

    * Two serial UART interfaces (RS232) with DSUB9 connectors

    * Ethernet 10/100 Mbps RMII interface with RJ45 connector

    * Two CAN bus interfaces (ISO 11898) with DSUB9 connectors

    * Two SpaceWire interfaces with MDM9 connectors

    * Four optional SpaceWire interfaces with MDM9 connectors

    * JTAG debug interface

  * Interfaces at back edge of board:

    * +5 V power connector

    * 26 input and 38 input/output general purpose pins

    * 20 RS422 transmit pairs

    * 20 RS422 receiver pairs

  * Interfaces on-board:

    * Dual MIL-STD-1553B communication interfaces on DSUB9 connector

    * I2C master interface on pin headers

    * SPI master interface on pin headers

    * Headers and jumpers

    * Reset push button and LED indicators
