notes: |
  The directive accesses a device provided by the
  ${/glossary/clock-driver:/term} to get the time in the highest precision
  available to the system.  Alternatively, the
  ${get-realtime-coarse:/name} directive may be used to get the time with less
  precision and less runtime overhead.

  See ${get-realtime-bintime:/name} and ${get-realtime-timeval:/name} to get
  the time in alternative formats.

    is the pointer to a ${/c/if/timespec:/name} object.  The time elapsed since
    the ${/glossary/unix-epoch:/term} measured using the
    ${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term} at some time point during the directive
    call will be stored in this object.  Calling the directive with a pointer
    equal to ${/c/if/null:/name} is undefined behaviour.
