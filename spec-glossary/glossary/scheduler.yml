  A scheduler or scheduling algorithm allocates processors to a subset of
  its set of ready tasks.  So it manages access to the processor resource.
  Various algorithms exist to choose the tasks allowed to use a processor
  out of the set of ready tasks.  One method is to assign each task a
  priority number and assign the tasks with the lowest priority number to
  one processor of the set of processors owned by a scheduler instance.

  A scheduler is either an ${scheduler-eligible:/term} or a
  ${scheduler-ineligible:/term} for a task.  An ${scheduler-eligible:/term} is
  either the ${scheduler-home:/term} or a ${scheduler-helping:/term} for a
  task.
