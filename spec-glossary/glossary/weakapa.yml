term: Weak APA
text: |
  Weak APA is a specialization of ${apa:/term}.  This refers to Linux's push
  and pull implementation of APA model. When a ${thread:/term} becomes ready
  for execution, it is allocated a processor if there is an idle processor, or
  a processor executing a lower priority thread in its affinity set.  Unlike
  ${strongapa:/term}, no thread is migrated from its processor to find a thread
  to processor mapping.  See also :cite:`Cerqueira:2014:LPA`.
