notes: |
  This object class can be configured in unlimited allocation mode, see
  :ref:`ConfigUnlimitedObjects`.

  This calculations for the required memory in the RTEMS Workspace for
  threads assume that each thread has a minimum stack size and has floating
  point support enabled.  The configuration option
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_EXTRA_TASK_STACKS` is used to specify thread stack
  requirements **above** the minimum size required.  See :ref:`Reserve
  Task/Thread Stack Memory Above Minimum` for more information about
  ``CONFIGURE_EXTRA_TASK_STACKS``.

  The maximum number of Classic API Tasks is specified by
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_TASKS`.

  All POSIX threads have floating point enabled.
