text: |
  A task priority of a ${task:/term} determines its importance relative to
  other tasks.  The scheduler use task priorities to determine which
  ${readytask:/term} gets a processor allocated, see ${scheduledtask:/term}.  The
  ${priority-eligible:/plural} of a task define the position of the task in a
  ${waitqueue:/term} which uses the priority discipline.  Each task has at
  least the ${priority-real:/term}.
