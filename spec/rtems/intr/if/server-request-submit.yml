  pending entries of the interrupt server.  The interrupt server is notified

notes: |
  This directive may be used to do a two-step interrupt processing.  The first
  step is done from within interrupt context by a call to this directive.  The
  second step is then done from within the context of the interrupt server.

  No error checking is performed by the directive.

  A submitted request may be destroyed by ${server-request-destroy:/name}.
