notes: |
  By default, the interrupt vector of an interrupt server request is set to a
  special value which is outside the range of vectors supported by the
  interrupt controller hardware.

  Calls to ${server-request-submit:/name} will disable the interrupt vector of
  the request.  After processing of the request by the interrupt server the
  interrupt vector will be enabled again.
