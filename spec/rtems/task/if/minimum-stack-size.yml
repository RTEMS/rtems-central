  It is the minimum stack size recommended for use on this processor.  This
  value is selected by the RTEMS maintainers conservatively to minimize the risk
  of blown stacks for most user applications.  Using this constant when
  specifying the task stack size, indicates that the stack size will be at
  least RTEMS_MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE bytes in size.  If the user configured minimum
  stack size (see ${/acfg/if/min-task-stack-size:/name}) is larger than the
  recommended minimum, then it will be used.
