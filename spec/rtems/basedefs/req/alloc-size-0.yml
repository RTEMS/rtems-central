  When the code is compiled with the GNU C compiler,
  and the ${../if/alloc-size:/name} macro is used as last part of a
  function declaration,
  and ${../if/alloc-size:/params[0]/name} is a constant number
  referring to an argument of that function
  (counting of arguments starts at 1 from the left),
  and the declared function returns a pointer to memory with the size in bytes
  provided by the function argument number ${../if/alloc-size:/params[0]/name},
  the macro shall cause the compiler to improve the correctness of
  ``__builtin_object_sizepointer`` analysis.
