      This set of attributes specifies a test header.  In case a test header is
      specified, then instead of a test case a test run function will be
      generated.  The test run function will be declared in the test header
      target file and defined in the test source target file.  The test run
      function can be used to compose test cases.  The test header file is not
      automatically included in the test source file.  It should be added to
      the includes or local includes of the test.
