  enabled.

appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_STACK_CHECKER_ENABLED
appl-config-option-notes: |
  The stack checker performs run-time stack bounds checking.  This increases
  the time required to create tasks as well as adding overhead to each context
  switch.

  In 4.9 and older, this configuration option was named ``STACK_CHECKER_ON``.
