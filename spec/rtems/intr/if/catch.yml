  This directive establishes an interrupt service routine (ISR) for the
  interrupt specified by the ${.:/params[1]/name} number.  The
  ${.:/params[0]/name} parameter specifies the entry point of the ISR.  The
  entry point of the previous ISR for the specified vector is returned in
  ${.:/params[2]/name}.

  To release an interrupt vector, pass the old handler's address obtained when
  the vector was first capture.
