notes: |
  This is primarily intended as a mechanism to obtain a diagnostic information.
  This method forms am O(n) scan of the free and an O(n) scan of the used
  blocks in the region to calculate the information provided. Given that the
  execution time is driven by the number of used and free blocks, it can take a
  non-deterministic time to execute.

  To get only the free information of the region use
  ${get-free-information:/name}.
