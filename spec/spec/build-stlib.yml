      It shall be an external static library identifier.  The library is used
      to link programs referenced by this item, e.g. ``m`` for ``libm.a``.  The
      library is added to the build command through the ``stlib`` attribute.
      It shall not be used for internal static libraries.  Internal static
      libraries shall be specified through the ``use-after`` and ``use-before``
      attributes to enable a proper build dependency tracking.
