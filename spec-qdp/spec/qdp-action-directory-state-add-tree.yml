          It shall be a list of Python ``fnmatch`` patterns.  If a file path
          matches with the pattern, then the file is not added to the directory
          state.  The file paths are absolute paths relative to the base
          directory of the directory state.  For example, if the directory
          state has a base of ``/base`` and a file to include has the path
          ``/base/abc``, then the file path ``/abc`` is used to match with the
          exclude patterns.

      This set of attributes specifies a directory state add tree action.  The
      files of the directory tree starting at the root directory are added to
      the file set of the directory state.  The added file path is relative to
      the root directory.  The prefix is prepended to the file path for each
      file before it is added to the directory state.  The files are not copied
      or moved.
