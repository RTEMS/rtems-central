  This directive is used to increase or decrease the size of the
  ${.:/params[1]/name} of the region specified by ${.:/params[0]/name}.  When
  increasing the size of a segment, it is possible that there is no memory
  available contiguous to the segment.  In this case, the request is
  unsatisfied.

notes: |
  If an attempt to increase the size of a segment fails, then the application
  may want to allocate a new segment of the desired size, copy the contents of
  the original segment to the new, larger segment and then return the original
  segment.
