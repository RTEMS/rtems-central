appl-config-option-type: integer
appl-config-option-default-value: '``CPU_STACK_MINIMUM_SIZE``'
appl-config-option-description: |
  The value of this configuration option defines the minimum stack size in
  bytes for every user task or thread in the system.
appl-config-option-index:
- minimum task stack size
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_MINIMUM_TASK_STACK_SIZE
appl-config-option-notes: |
  Adjusting this parameter should be done with caution.  Examining the actual
  stack usage using the stack checker usage reporting facility is recommended
  (see also :ref:`CONFIGURE_STACK_CHECKER_ENABLED`).

  This parameter can be used to lower the minimum from that recommended. This
  can be used in low memory systems to reduce memory consumption for
  stacks. However, this must be done with caution as it could increase the
  possibility of a blown task stack.

  This parameter can be used to increase the minimum from that
  recommended. This can be used in higher memory systems to reduce the risk
  of stack overflow without performing analysis on actual consumption.

  By default, this configuration parameter defines also the minimum stack
  size of POSIX threads.  This can be changed with the
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_MINIMUM_POSIX_THREAD_STACK_SIZE`
  configuration option.

  In releases before RTEMS 5.1 the ``CONFIGURE_MINIMUM_TASK_STACK_SIZE`` was
  used to define the default value of :ref:`CONFIGURE_INTERRUPT_STACK_SIZE`.
appl-config-option-constraint:
  custom:
  - |
    It must be greater than or equal to a BSP-specific and application-specific
    minimum value.
  - |
    It must be small enough so that the task stack space calculation carried
    out by ``<rtems/confdefs.h>`` does not overflow an integer of type
    ``uintptr_t``.
