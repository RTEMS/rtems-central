  If this configuration option is undefined, then a clock driver may be
  initialized during system initialization.
appl-config-option-description: |
  In case this configuration option is defined, then **no** clock driver is
  initialized during system initialization.
appl-config-option-index: []
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_DOES_NOT_NEED_CLOCK_DRIVER
appl-config-option-notes: |
  This configuration parameter is intended to prevent the common user error
  of using the Hello World example as the baseline for an application and
  leaving out a clock tick source.

  The application must define exactly one of the following configuration options

  * :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CLOCK_DRIVER`,

  * :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_DOES_NOT_NEED_CLOCK_DRIVER`, or

  * :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_TIMER_DRIVER`,

  otherwise a compile time error will occur.
