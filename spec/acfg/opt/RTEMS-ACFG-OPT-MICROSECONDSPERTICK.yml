appl-config-option-data-type: |
  Unsigned integer (``uint32_t``).
appl-config-option-default-value: |
  This is not defined by default. When not defined, the clock tick quantum is
  configured to be 10,000 microseconds which is ten (10) milliseconds.
appl-config-option-description: |
  This constant is  used to specify the length of time between clock ticks.

  When the clock tick quantum value is too low, the system will spend so much
  time processing clock ticks that it does not have processing time available
  to perform application work. In this case, the system will become
  unresponsive.

  The lowest practical time quantum varies widely based upon the speed of the
  target hardware and the architectural overhead associated with
  interrupts. In general terms, you do not want to configure it lower than is
  needed for the application.

  The clock tick quantum should be selected such that it all blocking and
  delay times in the application are evenly divisible by it. Otherwise,
  rounding errors will be introduced which may negatively impact the
  application.
appl-config-option-index:
- tick quantum
appl-config-option-name: CONFIGURE_MICROSECONDS_PER_TICK
appl-config-option-notes: |
  This configuration parameter has no impact if the Clock Tick Device driver
  is not configured.

  There may be BSP specific limits on the resolution or maximum value of a
  clock tick quantum.
appl-config-option-range: |
  Positive.
