  This section describes multiprocessing related configuration options.
  The options are only used if RTEMS was built when the multiprocessing
  build configuration option is enabled. The multiprocessing configuration
  is distinct from the SMP configuration.  Additionally, this class of
  configuration options are only applicable if the configuration option
  ${mp-appl:/name} is defined.  The multiprocessing (MPCI)
  support must not be confused with the SMP support.
