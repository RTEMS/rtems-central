text: |
  The CLOCK_MONOTONIC is a clock provided by RTEMS which measures the time
  since an unspecified starting point.  In contrast to ${clock-realtime:/term},
  this clock cannot be set.  It may be affected by incremental adjustments for
  example carried out by the ${ntp:/term} or the use of a ${pps:/term} signal.
  See also ${clock-realtime:/term}, ${clock-tick:/term}, and
  ${clock-driver:/term}.
