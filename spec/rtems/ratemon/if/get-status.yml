  This directive returns the detailed status of the rate monotonic period
  specified by ${.:/params[0]/name}.  The detailed status of the period will be
  returned in the members of the period status object referenced by
  ${.:/params[1]/name}:

  * The ``owner`` member is set to the identifier of the owner task of the
    period.

  * The ``state`` member is set to the current state of the period.

  * The ``postponed_jobs_count`` member is set to the count of jobs which are
    not released yet.

  * If the current state of the period is ${inactive:/name}, the
    ``since_last_period`` and ``executed_since_last_period`` members will be
    set to zero.  Otherwise, both members will contain time information since
    the last successful invocation of the ${period:/name} directive by the
    owner task.  More specifically, the ``since_last_period`` member will be
    set to the time elapsed since the last successful invocation.  The
    ``executed_since_last_period`` member will be set to the processor time
    consumed by the owner task since the last successful invocation.
