Developer: Jerzy Jaśkuć

SPIN/Promela based test generation framework for RTEMS Barrier Manager

This directory contains all of the necessary files needed to perform test generation for [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/ "RTEMS Homepage") [Barrier Manager](https://docs.rtems.org/branches/master/c-user/barrier/background.html "Barrier Manager") using SPIN/Promela framework.

It is a subset of the material available at [Jerzy Jaśkuć's project repository](https://github.com/EZCodes/SPIN-PromelaRTEMSTestGen).

These files were produced as a part of his research work done in Trinity College Dublin in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of MCS in Integrated Computer Science.
