  - It shall be greater than or equal to a Clock Driver specific value.
  - It shall be less than or equal to a Clock Driver specific value.
  - The resulting clock ticks per second should be an integer.
appl-config-option-default-value: 10000
appl-config-option-description: |
  The value of this configuration option defines the length of time in
  microseconds between clock ticks (clock tick quantum).

  When the clock tick quantum value is too low, the system will spend so much
  time processing clock ticks that it does not have processing time available
  to perform application work. In this case, the system will become
  unresponsive.

  The lowest practical time quantum varies widely based upon the speed of the
  target hardware and the architectural overhead associated with
  interrupts. In general terms, you do not want to configure it lower than is
  needed for the application.

  The clock tick quantum should be selected such that it all blocking and
  delay times in the application are evenly divisible by it. Otherwise,
  rounding errors will be introduced which may negatively impact the
  application.

appl-config-option-notes: |
  This configuration option has no impact if the Clock Driver is not
  configured, see :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_DOES_NOT_NEED_CLOCK_DRIVER`.

  There may be Clock Driver specific limits on the resolution or maximum value
  of a clock tick quantum.
