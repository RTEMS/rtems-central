    is the pointer to a ${/c/if/timeval:/name} object.  The seconds and
    microseconds elapsed since some time point during the system initialization
    and some point during the directive call using
    ${/glossary/clock-monotonic:/term} will be stored in this object.  The
    pointer shall be valid, otherwise the behaviour is undefined.
