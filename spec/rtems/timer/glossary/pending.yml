  The timers in ${../glossary/servercontext:/term} have a third
  ${../glossary/state:/term} "pending". A Timer enters
  ${../glossary/state:/term} pending when the time at which it is
  ${../glossary/scheduled:/term} to ${../glossary/fire:/term} as been reached
  but the ${../glossary/timerserviceroutine:/term} has not been invoked yet (for
  example because other tasks with higher priority are active).

  The pending ${../glossary/state:/term} can be left when

  * the ${../glossary/timerserviceroutine:/term} is eventually invoked
  * the timer is canceled by a call to ${../if/cancel:/name}
  * the timer is reset by a call to ${../if/reset:/name}
  * the timer is deleted by a call to ${../if/delete:/name}
