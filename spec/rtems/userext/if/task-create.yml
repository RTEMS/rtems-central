notes: |
  The task create extensions are invoked in
  ${/glossary/extension-forward-order:/term}.

  The task create extensions are invoked after a new task has been completely
  initialized, but before it is started.

  While normal tasks are created, the executing thread is the owner of the
  object allocator mutex.  The object allocator mutex allows nesting, so the
  normal memory allocation routines can be used allocate memory for the created
  thread.

  If the task create extension returns ${/c/if/false:/name}, then the task
  create operation stops immediately and the entire task create operation will
  fail.  In this case, all task delete extensions are invoked, see
  ${task-delete:/name}.
