    The test action is carried out by the thread-local objects definition and
    the application configuration.
  action-code: |
    /* Nothing to do */
  checks:
  - brief: |
      Check that the ${/acfg/if/max-thread-local-storage-size:/name}
      application configuration option resulted in the expected system setting.
      Since at least one thread-local objects is available, the referenced
      requirement is validated.
