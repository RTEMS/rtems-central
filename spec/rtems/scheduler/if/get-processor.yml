  Where the system was built with SMP support disabled, this directive
  evaluates to a compile time constant of zero.

  Where the system was built with SMP support enabled, this directive returns
  the index of the current processor.  The set of processor indices is the
  range of integers starting with zero up to ${get-processor-maximum:/name}
  minus one.

  Outside of sections with disabled thread dispatching the current processor
  index may change after every instruction since the thread may migrate from
  one processor to another.  Sections with disabled interrupts are sections
