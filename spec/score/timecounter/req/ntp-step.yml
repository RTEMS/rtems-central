  Let ``T`` be the seconds value of the ${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term} time
  point of the timehand which is currently updated, let ``S`` be the seconds
  value of the ${/glossary/clock-realtime:/term} time point of the previous
  timehand, let ``D`` be ``T`` minus ``S``, while the ${/glossary/ntp:/term}
  handler is not ${/c/if/null:/name}, while ``D`` is greater than or equal to
  one, while ``D`` is less than or equal to 200, while the timehand is updated,
  the ${/glossary/ntp:/term} handler shall be called exactly ``D`` times.
