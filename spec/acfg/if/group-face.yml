  This section describes configuration options related to adapting
  RTEMS behavior to be aligned with the FACE Technical Standard.
  The FACE Technical Standard is a product of the FACE Consortium
  which operates under the Open Group. The FACE Consortium was founded
  by avionics organizations to improve the portability of cockpit software
  across various platforms. It addresses technical and business concerns.

  Most important from an RTEMS perspective, the FACE Technical Standard
  defines four POSIX profiles: Security, Safety Base, Safety Extended, and
  the General Purpose Profile. Each has an increasingly larger subset of
  POSIX APIs. In the Security and Safety profiles, ARINC 653 is required.
  It is optional in the General Purpose Profile.

  The RTEMS Project has been tracking alignment with the FACE POSIX profiles
  and they are included in the "RTEMS POSIX 1003.1 Compliance Guide."
