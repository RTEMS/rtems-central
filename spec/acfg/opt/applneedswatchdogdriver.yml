  In case this configuration option is defined, then the Watchdog Driver is
  initialized during system initialization.

appl-config-option-notes: |
  Most BSPs do not include support for a watchdog device driver. This is
  because many boards do not include the required hardware.

  If this is defined and the BSP does not have this device driver, then the
  user will get a link time error for an undefined symbol.
