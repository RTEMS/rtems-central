  algorithm is made available to the application.

appl-config-option-notes: |
  This scheduler configuration option is an advanced configuration option.
  Think twice before you use it.

  In case no explicit :ref:`clustered scheduler configuration
  <ConfigurationSchedulersClustered>` is present, then it is used as the
  scheduler for exactly one processor.

  This scheduler algorithm is the default when
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_PROCESSORS` is
  exactly one.

  The memory allocated for this scheduler depends on the
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_PRIORITY` configuration option.
