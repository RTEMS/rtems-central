  A period is in active ${../glossary/state:/term} if a time
  ${../glossary/interval:/term} is set and the end
  ${../glossary/deadline:/term} has not yet been reached.  In active
  ${../glossary/state:/term} either the ${../glossary/ownertask:/term}
  executes the current ${../glossary/job:/term} or the
  ${../glossary/ownertask:/term} is waiting for the end of the current
  ${../glossary/interval:/term} inside the ${../if/period:/name} directive.

  A period enters active ${../glossary/state:/term} by a call to
  ${../if/period:/name} if it was before in ${../glossary/inactive:/term}
  or ${../glossary/expired:/term} ${../glossary/state:/term}.

  A period leaves active ${../glossary/state:/term} when the execution of the
  current ${../glossary/job:/term} passes over the next
  ${../glossary/deadline:/term} (no matter whether this
  ${../glossary/deadline:/term} belongs to the current
  ${../glossary/interval:/term} or not) or by a call to ${../if/cancel:/name}.
