  The directive enables the interrupt vector specified by ${.:/params[0]/name}.
  This allows that interrupt service requests are issued to the target
  processors of the interrupt vector.  Interrupt service requests for an
  interrupt vector may be raised by ${raise:/name}, ${raise-on:/name},
  external signals, or messages.
