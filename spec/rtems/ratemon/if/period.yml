description: |
  This directive initiates the rate monotonic period specified by
  ${.:/params[0]/name}  with a length of period ticks specified by
  ${.:/params[1]/name}.  If the period is running, then the calling task will
  block for the remainder of the period before reinitiating the period with the
  specified period length.  If the period was not running (either expired or
  never initiated), the period is immediately initiated and the directive
  returns immediately.  If the period has expired, the postponed job will be
  released immediately and the following calls of this directive will release
  postponed jobs until there is no more deadline miss.

  If invoked with a period length of ${period-status-define:/name} ticks, the
  current state of the period will be returned.  The directive status indicates
  the current state of the period.  This does not alter the state or period
  length of the period.
