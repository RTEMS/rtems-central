notes: |
  By default, the IDLE task storage areas are allocated from the RTEMS
  Workspace.  Applications which do not want to use a heap allocator can use
  this configuration option to use statically allocated memory for the IDLE
  task storage areas.  The task storage area contains the task stack, the
  thread-local storage, and the floating-point context on architectures with a
  separate floating-point context.  The size of the thread-local storage area
  is defined at link time or by the ${max-thread-local-storage-size:/name}
  configuration option.  You have to estimate the actual thread-local storage
  size if you want to use this configuration option.  If the IDLE task stack
  size would be less than the value defined by the
  ${idle-task-stack-size:/name} configuration option, for example because the
  thread-local storage size is larger than expected, then the system terminates
  with the ${/score/interr/if/internal-error-core:/name} fatal source and the
  ${/score/interr/if/idle-thread-stack-too-small:/name} fatal code during
  system initialization.

  The value of this configuration option is passed to
  ${/rtems/task/if/storage-size:/name} by ${header-confdefs:/path} to determine
  the actual size of the statically allocated area to take
  architecture-specific overheads into account.

  The

  * ``CONFIGURE_IDLE_TASK_STORAGE_SIZE``, and

  * ${task-stack-allocator-for-idle:/name}

  configuration options are mutually exclusive.
