appl-config-option-default: |
  If this configuration option is undefined, then a base filesystem and the
  configured filesystems are initialized during system initialization.
appl-config-option-description: |
  In case this configuration option is defined, then **no** base filesystem is
  initialized during system initialization and **no** filesystems are
  configured.
appl-config-option-index: []
appl-config-option-notes: |
  Filesystems must be initialized to support file descriptor based device
  drivers and basic input/output functions such as :c:func:`printf`.
  Filesystems can be disabled to reduce the memory footprint of an application.
